<h2 id="about">About this Course</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>If you want to take your website to the next level, the ability to incorporate 
interactivity is a must. But adding some of these types of capabilities requires a 
stronger programming language than HTML5 or CSS3, and JavaScript can provide just 
what you need.</p>

<p>With just a basic understanding of the language, you can create a page that will react 
to common events such as page loads, mouse clicks &amp; movements, and even keyboard input. 
This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language. We will cover 
concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging
tools.</p>

<p>You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify 
and modify specific parts of your page. After the course, learners will be able to react to 
DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page. The class will 
culminate in a final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and 
verifies input.</p>

<p>This is the third course in the Web Design for Everybody specialization. A basic 
understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class. Additional 
courses focus on enhancing the styling with responsive design and completing a capstone 
project.</p>

<h2 id="ch1">Week 1: Data Types - Welcome to Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>This course is an introduction to the use of the JavaScript programming language to add 
some interactivity to your website. This course is meant for people who are comfortable 
using HTML and CSS, but are new to programming.</p>

<p>What is the benefit of learning JavaScript? HTML and CSS are not programming languages 
and therefore they are not very powerful. You can do some really interesting things with 
the new tags and properties, but there are limitations. JavaScript, on the other hand, 
allows you to add complex levels of interactivity to your pages. And unlike some other
programming languages, JavaScript works really well with the DOM structure of web pages.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks, we will talk about how you can add pop-up boxes (not always a good 
idea), change the structure and style of your page when special events happen (sometimes a 
good idea), and validate form data (always a good idea). To be completely honest, there are 
so many things that we can do with JavaScript we can't possibly cover them all in the time 
we have. We will focus on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to create output with JavaScript. This could be with pop up boxes, adding 
    content to your page, or sending information to the browser console help you fix 
    ("debug") your code.</li>
  <li>How JavaScript uses variables and data types to save your data. This is a powerful 
    and important concept because it lets you save information to use over and over again.</li>
  <li>How to write functions to react to events. You will be able to write code that only 
    runs when special events occur. Because we want to add interactivity, we will make sure 
    to use special DOM events that react to mouse clicks and movement.</li>
  <li>Why arrays are an important part of any programming language and how to use them to 
    store multiple pieces of information in one variable.</li>
  <li>How to create and validate HTML forms.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-obj">1.00 Learning Objectives</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>Hi everybody. Today I'm going to introduce you to the JavaScript programming language. 
JavaScript has a lot of uses, but we're really going to focus on how we can use JavaScript 
to add interactivity to your web design pages. While I'm assuming that you're new to 
programming, there is an expectation that you know HTML 5 and CSS. If you don't, you're 
going to want to go back and review those two areas because everything with JavaScript is 
based on web programming.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 04. what you can do with it (06) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image004.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="What You Can Do With It"
  alt="What You Can Do With It."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If you've done HTML, if you've done CSS, you haven't necessarily done what we 
call real programming, at least not what us computer scientists call real programming. 
Instead, we're going to be talking in JavaScript about really definite data manipulation, 
and in order to do that, there are a few things you need to learn first. You want to 
learn how to store variables. You're going to want to learn how to set decision points, 
you're going to be looping and writing functions, you're also going to be getting 
in-depth with how you can get data from the browser.</p>

<p>Did you know that every time you load a web page, you can get back the title of the 
page, the URL of your page, and a lot of different information that you know is there, 
but you can't always see at first glance?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 05. what you can do with it, #2 (06) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image005.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="What You Can Do, #2"
  alt="What You Can Do, #2."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The other thing we can do, which is really where it gets a little bit more exciting, 
is that we can manipulate the DOM that the browsers use to create webpages. The DOM is 
the Document Object Model, it's what builds up a webpage. If you're a little fuzzy, it's 
been a little while, don't worry. We're going to review the DOM in a future lecture.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 06. variables (07) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image006.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Variables: Store data and refer back to it later"
  alt="Variables: Store data and refer back to it later."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let's start with variables. In computer science, we use variables in order to store 
information. Your program isn't going to be very exciting if you ask somebody their 
name and then you can't actually use that name later on. You're going to find out how 
to get information from the user, and then store it so you can use it later.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 07. decision points (07) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image007.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Decision Points: use control statements"
  alt="Decision Points: use control statements."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>We're also going to add decision points. Things are much more interesting when 
they don't do the same thing every single time. We're going to write a little bit 
of code that can help the program decide in some cases I want to do this and in 
other cases, I want to do that. We call this decision points.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. looping, #1 (08) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image008.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Looping, #1"
  alt="Looping, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>We can also do looping. Looping is really powerful. As your programs get bigger, there's 
certain things you'll want to do over and over again, but you don't want to write code 
over and over and over again. In computer science, we use something called looping to 
control the program and say, see that little bit of code over there? We want to do that 
five times, or ten times, or we want to keep doing it until the human does what we want 
them to do.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 09. looping, #2 (08) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image009.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Looping, #2"
  alt="Looping, #2."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Otherwise, you sometimes have to decide at run time how many times you want to run some 
code. If you know that you want someone to do something five times, you can be very specific 
about it. Programming gives you so much flexibility in how you want your code to run.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 10. functions (09) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image010.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Functions"
  alt="Functions"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Next in this course we're going to talk about functions. Functions are one, are a way 
for you to reuse your code multiple times, but you only have to write it once. The other 
really great things about functions is that other people can write code and you can use 
it, and you don't even need to know how it works all you need to know is, what did you 
call your function? Great. I want to use that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 11. manipulating the dom (09) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image011.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Manipulating the DOM"
  alt="Manipulating the DOM."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Finally, we're going to talk about manipulating the dominant class. JavaScript can 
actually go through your web page and search and find certain elements. It can add new 
elements. It can delete other elements from the DOM. So, think about when you're filling 
out a form on a web page with your credit card information. There are always these 
little buttons that you can click that can say use the same billing address for shipping. 
Things like this can make your page much more usable.</p>

<p>You can also react to mouse clicks, page reloads, and other actions that the user 
might have. This is where it really gets fun. We're going to start with the basics, 
the variables, the loopings, and then we're going to have fun manipulating the DOM.</p>

  alt="Review"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>A major component of learning any new programming language, or I guess, really any 
language at all, is that the key is practice and repetition.</p>

<p>The other thing that you really need to understand, and I'm actually hoping that 
you'll embrace, is that you need to expect that you're going to make mistakes. If you 
aren't making mistakes constantly, you aren't really learning in this class. Join us, 
we're going to do a lot of fun stuff. But I promise, I'm going to go slow, explain 
what I'm doing step by step, so that you can come along with me and start adding some
interactivity to your pages with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here is a link to a collection of all of the Code for Week One. (There may be a few 
extra files in there as I play with new examples.) Each individual file is also linked 
above. I find that it can be annoying to use CodePen for the first few lectures since 
it causes a lot of pop-up boxes. Don't worry, we move away from that by Week Two.</p>

<p>Even if you use CodePen, I encourage you to practice writing the code on your own. 
For now, I put complete examples in CodePen, but as time goes on, I will remove some 
of the commands to link the code together. You will need to work on that part on your 
own...</p>

Examples of web and XML development using Document Object Model (DOM)</a></p>

<p>One of the reasons you want to learn about JavaScript is that it works so well with 
the structure used to create HTML documents. Every webpage can be broken down into a 
mathematical tree structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). Each HTML tag is 
a node in the tree and these nodes have all types of different attributes, such as 
text, background color, width, etc.</p>

<p>With JavaScript it is easy to write code that basically says "I want to grab 
<em>that</em> part of the webpage and change it." In this lecture I review the DOM 
and talk about how it is related to JavaScript. There is no code associated with 
this lecture, but if you check under the resources, I do include a link to site 
where you can find specifics on the DOM.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Today we're going to be talking about the DOM, or the document object model.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 14. web pages are built upon the dom (11) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image014.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  title="Web pages are built upon the DOM"
  alt="Web pages are built upon the DOM."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>As you may or may not remember, every webpage is built upon this DOM. And what it 
means is that our pages are structured like a tree. We have one parent and possibly a 
few children. And the page as you add more and more things it just gets deeper and deeper. 
Nodes have different properties, methods, and events.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 15. sample document, #1 (12) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image015.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Sample Document, #1"
  alt="Sample Document, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let me draw you a quick example and then we'll talk about how we can use JavaScript 
to manipulate this DOM. Every web page is built like a tree. We start up here and we've 
got our document and then you're going to have, hopefully you remember your head and 
your body, all right?</p>

<p>Well, what kind of things are in your webpage? You might have a div and another div. 
And then the third div we're going to give more specific. We'll say, well this div has 
three paragraphs and one of those paragraphs has the id equals 3. What does this mean? 
Why do we care that the pages built like a tree?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 16. sample document, #2 (12) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image016.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Sample Document, #2"
  alt="Sample Document, #2."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>This means that JavaScript can actually go in and it can look and say, you know what, 
I want to find the second div. I found this thing right here. I want to find the specific 
paragraph that had the id equals 3. It's right here.</p>

<p>Because JavaScript can find these different elements in your page, it can also change 
what we call are the attributes of that page. For instance, that paragraph might have a 
background color or a special kind of font, the paragraph also has text in it. How can 
we go in there and how can we change that text? This is what we're going to be using
JavaScript to do in this course.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17. the dom and javascript (13) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image017.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="The DOM and JavaScript"
  alt="The DOM and JavaScript."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Again, we've got that the page content is represented by the DOM. The scripting 
language JavaScript uses the DOM to interact with the document. How does it do that, 
though? How does it know how to interact?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 18. how does it work? (13) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image018.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How does it work?"
  alt="How does it work?"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Well, the JavaScript has something called an API, or an application programming interface. 
You may have heard people talking about APIs in the past. Programmers tend to do that. They're 
like, oh, what API are you using? Or what API are you using? And it can sound kind of 
intimidating if you've never used one before. An API is just a way for someone else to write 
code, and then you to use it, to interact with their programs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 19. how does it work, #2? (14) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image019.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How does it work, #2?"
  alt="How does it work, #2?"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>No matter which browser you're using, Firefox, Chrome, different things like that. 
And no matter which scripting language you're using, in our case we're going to use 
JavaScript. The API is always the same. The way you interact is always going to be 
the same. And this is really important, because it's nice to know that if you learn 
this you won't have to learn something different later on.</p>

<p>Let's talk about some of these DOM objects or element as we call them. The first 
one, kind of the root of your entire page, is the document. If you wanted to, you 
could find out what the document URL is, what the height of the document is, all 
the different links in the document, the document background color. If there's an 
attribute you've used to style your page, you can find it using JavaScript in the
API.</p>

<p>The next kind of concept we talk about is an element, or a node in the tree. If you 
remember, I drew that you can have the body, and inside the body you could have divs, 
paragraphs, links, list items. Each one of those is a node in the tree. And you can find 
it using the API.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, it can be a little bit more complicated than just returning a 
single element. What if you wanted to find all of the children of one particular ordered 
list, or un-ordered list? Well, in that case, instead of returning a single element, 
sometimes it's returned a node list, or an array of elements.</p>

<p>For instance, there's this one API that we can use, called document that get element 
by tag name, and you can give it any element you want. So, p, or a list item. Well, 
there's a really good chance that there's more than one paragraph in your page. You 
return all of them together. This is how we're going to be using arrays later in the 
course, probably around week three, to help you understand how to deal with an overload
of information.</p>

<p>Finally, the important thing I need you to remember is that in the DOM there are 
attributes. You have your elements and every element probably has one or more attributes 
that go with it. So, an image for image element, it would have a source, it would have 
alt text, it would have width, and a style, different things like that.</p>

<p>Attributes are the kind of cool things that we want you to be able to
change to make your page look different.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Okay, so if you understand that the page is made up of documents, and elements, and 
attributes, I'm hoping this side will make a little bit more sense. For a view of a 
document, you can say you know that I want to get a certain element using the id. You 
can also say oh I've got this document grab all the elements that happen to be a 
paragraph or a link. Now this one's new, this idea of element.inner.HTML.</p>

<p>A paragraph is an element and you assume there is some sort of text inside that 
paragraph. Well, if you've been coding HTML or CSS, you probably might be thinking, 
when I use the paragraph tag, I never saw an inner HTML attribute. You wouldn't have. 
This is part of the API, but you can use this to change the content of any element. You 
can also change the element style, and you can even add additional attributes to any 
element that the DOM can grab.</p>

<p>Finally, an interesting one that you may or may not use, is you can even remove 
attributes. If something has a certain color, you can get rid of that if you want.</p>

<p>I know that there was a lot I went over in this slide that maybe didn't make a lot of 
sense to you yet. That's okay. That's the point of this class. It's so that the end of 
this course, you can go back to this slide, and you can say, oh great, I've mastered 
this. I'm beginning to understand that learning JavaScript doesn't mean that I know how 
to code everything by hand, it means that I know that there's something called an API and 
I know how I can use it to make my page a little bit better.</p>

<p>We're going to start slow, and the most important part to me is for you to feel 
comfortable searching for information on the web. I'll be able to teach you a little 
bit, I can show you some of the main methods and API's and different things like that. 
But I want you to code with me and then make sure you go off and you try to change things 
just a little bit until your confidence is really up there. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Accessing the DOM Methods</h3>

<p>In the earlier video I showed some ways to access the DOM. Here is a review of those 
methods, along with some additional information about the use of the newer methods 
document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll().</p>

<h3>Methods that return a single value</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The getElementById() method is one of the most common methods in the HTML 
    DOM. It is used almost every time you want to read or edit an HTML element. This 
	method returns an element with a specified ID value. If the page has two elements 
	with the same id (which it shouldn't!) only the first element in the DOM is returned. 
	There is no need to include the hashtag in the selector. Sample Code for getElementById 
	Note, JavaScript is case sensitive so make sure you have Id with an uppercase 
	"I" and a lowercase "d."</li>
  <li>While getElementById is only used for elements with a specific id, you 
    can also return a single element if you use querySelector. The querySelector() 
	method returns the first child element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) 
	of an element. You can use it to return the first h1 element (h1), the first 
	paragraph (p), the first link (a). If you want to search for an id, you must 
	include the hashtag (#) in the selector. If you want to search for a class you 
	must include a period (.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Methods that return a collection of elements</h3>

<p>It is possible to return a collection of elements rather than just one, for 
instance if you want to return all of the paragraph elements and not just the 
first one. Or all of the elements that share the same class. In that case you 
will want to use getElements (notice the s at the end) or querySelectorAll.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The getElementsByTagName()  method returns all of the elements with a given 
    tag name. Sample Code for getElementsByTagName.</li>
  <li>The getElementsByClassName() method returns all of the elements with a 
    specified class name(s). There is no need to include the period.  Sample Code 
	for getElementsByClassName (using one class) and Sample Code for getElementsByClassName 
	(using multiple classes).</li>
  <li>The querySelectorAll() method returns a collection of an element's child 
    elements that match a specified CSS selector(s). When using querySelectorAll 
	you must include the # if the selector is an id and a period if the selector 
	is a class. Sample Code for querySelectorAll.</li>
</ol>

<p>Important!  Even if there is just one element that matches the selector, that 
element is returned as part of an array so you will need to use an index to access it.</p>

<h3>Using getElement vs querySelector</h3>

<p>There are a few technical differences between your options. The getElement and 
getElements methods if the specific value doesn't exist, the method will return null. 
Both querySelector() and querySelectorAll() throw a SYNTAX_ERR exception if the 
selector(s) is invalid. The querySelector options are also faster. But there are 
less technical differences too. Do you often forget to use Id instead of ID? Then 
maybe you will prefer querySelector. If you are prone to forgetting the pound ‘#’ 
or the period ‘.’ in your selectors then maybe you would prefer the methods that 
describe the selectors, e.g getElementsByClassName. Here is an additional (optional) 
reading if you would like to learn more about the differences between the two groups 
of methods: querySelector vs getElementById</p>

<p>Hi everyone. Part of being a coder is realizing that you've been using the same code for a 
long time and that there's probably some newer things out there. This is just a quick video to 
throw out there some new methods that you might be seeing, or that you might want to use yourself.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 24. selecting the first element (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  title="Selecting the First Element"
  alt="Selecting the First Element."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>We've been using getElementById(). How it works is that it takes a single parameter, and 
that parameter must be an Id selector. If you say getElementById(h1), it won't know that 
you're actually looking for an h1 tag, is looking for something with the ID=h1.</p>

<p>If you're interested in selecting the first element of a certain type, another option 
for you is the querySelector() method. Similar to getElementById, it's going to return 
the first result. But that selector can be anything. Well, anything except for pseudo-
elements. The selector can be a tag name. It can be an ID. It can be a class. It can 
be a very complicated selector with tags, classes, and IDs all put together.</p>

<p>The thing to remember though, is if you decide to use querySelector, and you are 
looking for an ID or a class, you have to remember to include that hashtag # or the 
period. We'll do some examples later in the course to show you, but it's something 
that students often forget. I wanted to mention it right off the bat. If you're looking 
to select a single element, you can continue to use getElementById, or you can start to 
play around and use querySelector as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  title="Selecting Multiple Elements"
  alt="Selecting Multiple Elements."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If you want to select multiple elements, well, there's something called querySelectorAll(). 
It's pretty much identical to querySelector, but instead of returning a single element, it 
will return all the found values. The technical term for it is it'll return a node list, 
but let's just consider it an array because that's what we call it in this class. Again, 
while getElementsByClassName doesn't need to include that dot period in your selector, 
querySelectorAll does. You need to be very specific about exactly what selector you're 
looking for. But it's not really that complicated. Think back to all the code you've 
been writing in your CSS. If you can write a selector to style something, then you 
can definitely write a selector for JavaScript to grab it to manipulate the DOM.</p>

  title="Deciding on a method"
  alt="Deciding on a method."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Which one should you use? Should you be using querySelector and querySelectorAll? 
Should you be using getElementById or getElementsByClassName? Well, the important 
thing is for you and the type of codding that you're doing, speed won't be an issue. 
People get online and they debate as to one's faster than another, and to be honest, 
you could have done a lot more with that time in your life, than compare the two of 
them. Don't worry about that. querySelector is nice in that it does allow you to 
use any CSS selector that you'd like. To be honest, I'm less prone to typos when 
I use the method name. When I use querySelector, sometimes I forget to include that 
hashtag or the period. But to be honest, sometimes when I do getElementById, I love 
how it's mnemonic. I know exactly what I'm looking for, but sometimes I accidentally 
capitalize the "d" in ById and then it doesn't work. Or if I'm using getElementsByClassName, 
you'll even notice sometimes when I'm doing demos in this class, I forget the ‘s’. 
I write "getElementByClassName". I liked that some of them have more descriptive 
names. I like how others are a little less prone to typos. My suggestion is you do 
you, you do it whichever way you prefer. But don't be scared off if you see code 
online that uses the other approach. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Semicolons</h3>

<p>Adding a semicolon (;) indicates that you have completed a statement. However, 
unless you are writing multiple statements on the same line, you don't need to add 
a semicolon.</p>

<p>During this course you will definitely notice that I am in the habit of adding a 
semicolon to the end of every line. This is a habit I have because I write in a lot 
of different programming languages at the same time and the semicolon is required 
in some and not others.</p>

<p>Hi everybody. Today, let's start coding a little bit to see some of
things we can do with JavaScript. Maybe, using HTML 5 or CSS 3, you've
added what we call a little bit of interactivity to your page. There's
the details tag if you're using HTML. There's the hover property or
pseudo class if you're using CSS 3 and you were able to make little
things change in your page by reacting to what the user was doing.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>But typically, that's not really what we call interactivity when
we're talking about true web design because these new elements and the
pseudo classes can only go so far. They tend to be temporary
changes.</p>

  alt="What can JavaScript do?"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>So, what can JavaScript do that HTML and CSS can't do? Well, the one
that I'm going to talk about today is that they can read and write HTML
elements. Now that's not the only thing they can do. We're going to be
talking about different things like reacting to events and validating
data and different things like that. But today, we're really going to
focus on output.</p>

<p>Whenever you learn a new programming language, one of the first
things you want to do is find out how can I make things happen. How can
I have things print out to the screen or generate some sort of
output.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image030.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="JavaScript output"
  alt="JavaScript output."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Well, JavaScript doesn't have a built-in print function. Instead, you
have four or five different ways where you can generate different
things. Data is typically displayed via alerts, prompts,
<strong>document.write, innertHTML</strong> or reading information
directly to the console. Let's talk about each one of these.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="border displayed"

  alt="alert() example."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>You've all seen alert JavaScript alert boxes. Because many times,
especially back maybe 10, 15 years ago, when you went to a page, people
loved to have these little boxes pop up and say hey, welcome. Doing
things like that. In JavaScript it's pretty easy. You can just use alert
and then inside you put my message here. A few things just to point out
right from the beginning.</p>

<p>Alert is a keyword. In your editor it should change some sort of
special color. Inside the parentheses, and you need the parentheses,
both beginning parentheses and end parentheses, is that you're going to
have some sort of string and it should be inside quotes. It can be
inside single quotes or double quotes. And then, the last thing is, to
end in a semicolon. If you were to put this code right here inside your
HTML, you can generate some output.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="HTML alert example in script and noscript"
  alt="HTML alert example in script and noscript."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let me show you an example. What I've done over here is I've created
the HTML that I would need to generate an alert box. I've got my body
tag, now this is new I have what we call is a script tag. The script tag
tells the browser, oh wait, don't just print this out, I'm actually
going to give you some JavaScript that I want you to run. And in this
case, I have my code alert("Hello World").</p>

  title="Pop-up alert box"
  alt="Pop-up alert box."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If I were to run this, and I'm going to refresh it. You can see I get my little 
pop-up box. Now, if you're running this along with me at home, and you're not using 
Chrome, the box is going to look different. For some of you it's going to have the 
little Safari symbol, or the Edge, or Firefox.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  title="Generate output using alert"
  alt="Generate output using alert."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>That's okay, the important thing is that somewhere in here it says
hello world. Now you might be click on the prevent this page from
creating additional dialogues button. Don't do it. Because in this class
we're going to be playing with alert a lot because it's a nice way for
you to know if your code's working or not. Again, this is just a quick
and simple way for you to generate output using the alert.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 35. prompt() example (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image035.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="prompt() example"
  alt="prompt() example."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The next way we can generate output is using prompt. Prompt is very
similar to alert, but it's slightly different in that it wants you to do
more than just click OK or Cancel. It wants you to generate some sort of
input to put in there. As you can see, the alert and the prompt look
very similar. They've both got the key word, the parentheses, the
semicolon and the string, but the way they act is very different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:40%" >

<p>In this case when you run it, it's actually waiting for you to type
something in. I can put in Colleen van Lent and hit OK. Now, don't get
too excited. We didn't do anything with the stuff I put in. But, again,
I'm just giving you some of the different options. So, you have alert
and you have prompt and both of them generate some sort of box where you
can display information, but nothing is actually showing up on the page.
Let's switch to the general ways in which you can generate output to the
screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 37. document.write() example (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image037.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="document.write()"
  alt="document.write()"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>One way, if you want something to be what we call permanent, to not
just disappear once you hit okay, is to use what we call
<strong>document.write</strong>. So again, I'm hoping that you're
picking up on these ideas that we're using terms like document, and
element, and different things like that. The way that
<strong>document.write</strong> works is it goes through and it says, we
want you to write something directly to the page. We want it to become
part of the dom, we want it to become part of the page permanently. In
this case I can't just use write. That won't work. Alert worked by
itself, prompt worked by itself, but here you need to have
<strong>document.write()</strong>. Same thing, hopefully you're seeing
the pattern. Let's see when we add this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 38. document.write() example (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image038.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="document.write() example output"
  alt="document.write() example output."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Here you can see that inside the script tag, again, I have the
<strong>document.write()</strong>. But instead of things popping up or
asking us for input, it writes it directly into the screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39. generate output with document.write (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Generate output with document.write()"
  alt="Generate output with document.write()."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Now I'm going to change something right here. Because I put h1 inside
the quotes. If I get rid of that you can see this still works, but
instead of being an h1 heading, it’s just regular old text. So,
<strong>document.write</strong> is a way for you to generate output. But
we need to realize that it is probably not the best way to do it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40. example, document.write() (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image040.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, document.write()"
  alt="Example, document.write()"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Because sometimes if you're misusing it, you can overwrite other
things that exist. So, <strong>document.write</strong> is something you
just want to use when you're beginning and you don't know some of the
more complex methods.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 41. innerhtml (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image041.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="innerHTML"
  alt="innerHTML"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>One of the more complex methods you can use is called innerHTML. And
with innerHTML, you combine this with other functions that return
elements. So, you can't just say innerHTML or
<strong>element.innerHTML</strong>. You have to say, all right, what
part of the page do I want to change? Oh, I want to change that
particular paragraph, all right. But how do I grab that particular
paragraph? Or remember we have these different APIs that can go and get
things for us.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 42. example, innerhtml (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image042.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, element.innerHTML"
  alt="Example, element.innerHTML."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>In this case, I have element which is hopefully we'll find something
using the API that in your HTML equals time to learn JavaScript. I
wanted you to recognize something right away. When we use document dot
write alert and prompt we had parenthesis around the side, here. We
don't have that anymore. Instead, we use an equal and we just have it
ending with a semicolon. No parenthesis when you're using
<strong>inner.HTML</strong>. How do you figure that out when you're
coding? You don't. You just keep coding and practicing and after a
while, it becomes second nature to you, all right?</p>

<p>When I talk about this kind of generic element, I didn't make it a
color that's something that you need to grab using the API. Let me give
you an example of something we can do using innerHTML.</p>

<p>Let's look at this, what I've done is I made an <strong>h1</strong>
heading and I've given it the id of test. I also have a paragraph
element a little bit further down that just says, hey what happens if
I'd messed with this code?</p>

<p>All right, so I want you to look as closely as you can. You might be
on a small screen. You might not be able to see it. Is that in my h1
heading, I actually have the words tester, but if you look at the web
page, it says Hello World. Well, how did I do that? It's pretty simple,
actually. Because you can go in, and I can say
<strong>document.getElementById</strong>. Test. It's going to grab, it's
going to look through the page and go where, where can I find something
that says ID equals test. There it is. All right, now I want to change
whatever used to be in there and replace it with the words, Hello World.
This is kind of what happens when this is a weird example, but all early
examples are weird examples. Because you just want to get your feet
wet.</p>

that says, you really should see each ID only once.</p>

<p>JavaScript is expecting you to keep that rule. When you do something
get element by ID, JavaScript thinks there's only one out there. I'm
going to stop as soon as I find that one.</p>

<span style="font-family: Consolas, Inter, Helvetic, Bahnschrift, sans-serif;">
document.write</span> and enter HTML. Write directly into the
browser screen. What we have in this last option is something that
doesn't write to the browser screen, but it does write to the browser
console. Console dot log (
<span style="font-family: Consolas, Inter, Helvetic, Bahnschrift, sans-serif;">
console.log</span>) takes a message and says you know what, I want
to store this information some place. But I want it to be something that
not necessarily pops up and everyone can see.</p>

<p>The console's a place to see what's going on in your program during
execution. If you haven't used the console before, you might not realize

is a really handy tool if you want to do development but not let everyone see exactly 
what you are doing. We're going to come back to this example in just a second, but first

JavaScript error or you linked to a file that didn't exist. When I put
it back in, no more red syntax error.</p>

<p>I really want to stress this to you right now. I need you to stop and
make sure that you know how to access the console on your machine. One
of the things that really helps other people help you is when you can
pinpoint where exactly your code is going wrong. You might not know
what's going wrong, but you’re saying somewhere in this line of code I'm
getting an error. This kind of ability to help yourself debug is going
to be critical to going on and advancing in this course.</p>

development menu in menu box. And that will show you some of the
different JavaScript errors and tools that you have available. In Google
Chrome, you go to Developer, and then JavaScript Console. If you've been
coding with me in the past, you know that my shortcut is always to right
click, inspect element, and boom, there it is for you. If you're using
Firefox, you want to go to Tools and then Console. Firefox is, believed
by many to be the best browser to use when you're doing debugging for
JavaScript. If you're using Edge or Internet Explorer, typically hitting
F12 will bring up the different JavaScript and development tools that
you can use to improve your page. All right, so let's review.</p>

<p>Right now, we're doing really simple things, and I understand that.
It's not that exciting to just print things out to the screen or have
little pop-up boxes coming up. But we need to do these small steps to
help you gain the confidence to go on and write more complex bits of
code.</p>

<p>As you learn more, the power that you're going to have to manipulate
the dom is really going to get quite impressive. But for now, just make
the small mistakes, learn how to debug the small mistakes, and then that
way you'll be able to build your confidence slowly. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Trying to Create and Debug Your Own Output</h3>

<p>In the previous lecture I showed you how you can create output using
JavaScript. My code examples are all on CodePen and I have included a
link to each of the examples in the Resources section of that module.
With CodePen you get your own copy of my code that you can change. I
encourage you to experiment with that code, or even better try
recreating it yourself using an editor such as TextEdit, Sublime, or
Notepad++.</p>

<p>If you are using a laptop or desktop to do your coding, make sure to
use the console window of your browser to look for errors in your code.
In programming, looking for and correcting errors is called "debugging."
Below I have a screen shot of my code, the (empty) browser, and the
error message I get from the Chrome console. Don't worry if error
message itself doesn't make sense, that is something that comes with
time, the important part is to look for the line number, in this case
line 9. The console will always try to tell you about where it ran into
a problem. In this case, I didn't include the quotes to end the message
for the alert.</p>

<p>Hi, everybody. Today we're going to learn about JavaScript variables.
An important part of programming is learning how you can save data.
Because by saving data, you can reuse it and give you program that's
impression that's kind of intelligent and knows the user very well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 58. storing data example (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image058.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Storing data"
  alt="Storing data."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>In JavaScript, data is stored in what we call variables, and it's
very easy to use variables in your programming. The only important part
is that you need to tell the computer very specifically, hey, I need you
to save something for me. And this is how we do it. We start by using
the keyword var, V-A-R. When we're using the editor, hopefully this will
show up in some special color that indicates, ooh, this is a special
word to the computer. Next, you need to give your variable a name. Now,
I chose the name “name” here, but you can imagine it being age, first
name, last name, dob for date of birth. The important thing is that it
should be special to you, but not special to the computer.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 59. storing data variable and values (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image059.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Storing data variable and values"
  alt="Storing data variable and values."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>How does this work? When you declare a variable, you're basically
telling the computer, let's stop talking in human talk and let's talk
computer talk. So here, once you said var name, it reserved a space in
memory. It said oh, okay. I know that I'm talking about position 11011,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But Colleen doesn't want to talk about
those numbers, she wants to use the actual variable name. So, whenever
she talks about name, I know she actually wants me to use the value,
Christopher. There might be some variables that you've declared, such as
age, that you haven't put anything in there yet.</p>

<p>The important thing to know is that computers aren't smart. Computers
are just trying to give you a way to avoid remembering big long numbers
and instead using English words.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 60. variable name rules (38) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image060.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Variable name rules"
  alt="Variable name rules."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>When you come up with your variable name, there's a few rules that
you need to follow. Every variable name can have letters, digits,
underscores, and dollar signs in it. Now to be honest, I don't put
dollar signs in my JavaScript variable names because it can be very
confusing, particular for those people who know multiple programming
language. I tend to stick to letters, and sometimes digits and
underscores.</p>

<p>When you do come up with a variable name, even though numbers are
allowed, your variable can't start with a number. That number has to be
somewhere else in the middle or the end.</p>

<p>Also, variables are case-sensitive. What that means is that lower
case name is not the same thing as name with a capital N or name with a
capital M or name on all capitals. To the computer these are all
different variables. So, just be careful when you're programming and be
consistent.</p>

<p>Also, this last one isn't a rule so much as a suggestion that I want
to convey to you. Make your variable names meaningful or mnemonic as the
computer science term we use. That means, if the variable is storing
someone's name, call it name. If it's storing age, call it age. You
could get away with calling it 'yyy' or 'bbb', just don't do it. Okay?
Taking a little bit of time to give meaningful names will save you a lot
of heart ache later.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 61. variable assignments example (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image061.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Variable assignments example"
  alt="Variable assignments example."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If you're going to go to the trouble of declaring a variable and
telling the computer to save a spot in memory for it, it's pretty silly
if you don't then use your variable. And what I mean by use it, is you
should assign some sort of value to it.</p>

<p>When we assign things in computer science, we use what we call the
equal, or assignment operator. So, it looks like an equal sign, but we
call it assignment, because what we're doing is we're not saying hey,
are these two things the same, we're saying take the value and store it
into the variable.</p>

<p>So here I have <strong>var</strong> name, and instead of just leaving
it at that, I say, hey, I want you to store the name Colleen in there,
all right.</p>

  alt="Assignment statement example."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>This is where when we start talking about assignment statements, I
refer to LHS and RHS. I mean left-hand side and right-hand side of
statements. The left-hand side should always be the variable, alright so
this is going to be in our case name or some sort of element, something
that we want to change. The right-hand side is going to be that new
value that will be stored in the variable. Sometimes, the right-hand
side can be pretty long and complex.</p>

<p>Right here would be an example where I'm just having, I declare my
variable, and then later I want to update it. I say, name equals
Colleen. This works really well.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>What I need people to avoid is doing something along this line, where
they switch the left-hand side and the right-hand side. Mathematically,
if you're a math major, this makes perfect sense and it's the same
thing, but it's not okay in programming. Always put the variable on the
left-hand side.</p>

<p>All right, so I'm going to show you a few examples of how you might
use a variable. If you remember when we talked about output, one way
that we were able to produce output also was a way to generate input,
and that was the prompt.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, prompt, Date and window.location"
  alt="Example, prompt, Date and window.location."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>When you use the prompt, it's waiting for you to type something in
and when you type it in, it's going to store that in the name. Now can
we use that whenever we want to? We can say document dot write name and
we'll promote to the screen. Next, we can use another variable and say
hey, I want you to use this JavaScript function called date. And date is
going to return what the current date and time is, right now when you're
looking at the page. Then you can write that information out. You can
even use more from the API saying, you know what? I want to know where
this window is. What's the location of this window? And you can write
that out as well.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  title="Prompt example"
  alt="Prompt example."

<p>Let's look at a quick example of how we can use that. Let's start
with the simple code we used before when we were learning about
prompts.</p>

  alt="HTML code for prompt example."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Only now, I want to combine it with a variable, so I am going to go
in here and do var, and I'm actually just going to call it nm. The
reason I'm doing that instead of name is because I really want to make
people realize that the name you give your variable. Doesn't really
matter, it can be anything you want. Just because I call it name,
doesn't mean you have to.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:40%" >

<p>And as soon as I did this, the prompt statement showed up, and I put
in Colleen. Great, it worked, but we didn't do anything with it. Let's
add a bit more code. Now I am going to comment out this line. You can
see why, because otherwise it'll keep asking us to prompt things. We'll
comment that out when we're done. All right.</p>

something like <strong>document.write nm</strong>. I can also do
<strong>Console.log(nm)</strong>. If you wanted to you could even put in
<strong>alert(nm)</strong>. Let's put this back in. Might want to edit
all my typing out. What is your name? Well, it is Colleen.</p>

<p>Let's do one that has a little bit more going on with it. All right,
in this case we're going to talk a little bit more about how you can add
different things together, and how you can assign your variables using
more than just prompts. In this case, I declared a variable. We're going
to ask for the name. I write out the name. I write out the name twice
actually. Once with my name and then another time with an H1 heading.
And then I just wanted to show you that you could also grab other
information from the document, itself, such as the URL and the
title.</p>

<p>First thing I'm going to show you is, it says null and null. And
that's kind of weird, and it might happen to you and it might not. The
first thing I wanted to print out was my name, but I didn't type
anything in the prompt. When the JavaScript doesn't know what to do,
when it doesn't know what value should have been in there, it's going to
assign it a value of null.</p>

<p>Variables are a key component of really doing any type of programming
language at all. We're going to be using them throughout this entire
course, so I need you to practice them and feel comfortable using them.
Go into the code that I have on CodePen or online and change it, and see
if what you do does what you expect it to do. You might create some
errors and that's okay. That's a great practice using things that just
consult that log. The most important thing is I want you to understand
how variables work, so that you can use them throughout the rest of the

<p>In the next example, we have variable name equals Date. This is not a
string. This is something that actually can be quite a bit longer and is
very complex. You might also have variable name equals
<strong>window.location</strong>. If I wanted to in JavaScript, I could
even say name equals 12. Doesn't make any sense but there's nothing
stopping me from doing it. In each of these examples, name would have
what we call a different type. Things that are stored in the computer

<p>The first type we're going to talk about is number, and it's pretty
straightforward, it's simply any type of numerical value that you want
to store. This can be with or without decimals. JavaScript doesn't care
if it's 2 or 2.0 or 2.6785, it's all the same.</p>

<p>In this example, I went in and I said you know what, I have this
variable called width and I'm going to set it using
<strong>window.innerWidth</strong>. This is pretty cool actually if
you're trying to do something interesting in CSS because you can find
out how wide the window is and then use that information to update other
things.</p>

<p>My next example is I have <strong>var</strong> pi, which is equal to
3.14. In this case, I hard coded it to something. In both cases, it's
storing a number, but in the different cases or one, it's going to be,
normally would be an integer or a whole number, and the next time it has
decimals.</p>

  title="Example, String"
  alt="Example, String."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The next type is called String. String is simply a collection of
characters such as letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces, basically
anything you can type into the keyboard.</p>

<p>To create a string, you have to put the value in quotes. Now, these
can be single quotes or double quotes. And I want to be very clear here
that in PowerPoint it's drawn the quotes as kind of forward and forward.
Make sure you don't copy and paste and instead you do the quotes
directly from your keyboard because the slant does matter. In this case,
I've done var location = <strong>window.location</strong>. Because it
happens to be that that attribute is a string or in my second example
once again, I've just hardcoded it to something you might expect.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  title="Example Boolean"
  alt="Example, Boolean."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The third data type is Boolean. In programing, a boolean value is
something that is either true or false. It doesn't have numbers to it or
strings, it's very straightforward. In this case, I might have my
variable status equals false, this is again called hard coding it, or in
my program if I want to do something based on whether or not the window
is open or closed. I can set it dynamically right here. The important
thing to know is that status and window status can only be true or
false. Those are the only two options.</p>

<p>Later, we're going to learn how to write our own boolean expressions
to check to see if things are true or false. And that can add really a
lot of power to your page.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, Object"
  alt="Example, Object."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The next data type is called object. Because sometimes the variables
or the nodes are more complex than just a number or couple characters. A
node in the DOM would be a really good example. If you think about a
paragraph element to it, paragraphs are not just a number or a string,
there are a lot of different things that go into it. Here I might have
var topic = <strong>document.getElementById('myId')</strong>. If I
wanted to print out what topic is now, something like
<strong>document.RightTopic</strong>. I would get something that pretty
much looks like junk because it's an object, and objects can only read
illegibly using things like attributes.</p>

<p>Using those attributes, we can go in and we might be able to say
something along the lines of write out <strong>topic.style,
topic.innerHTML.</strong> Different things like that can show us really
the attributes or the string's numbers that make up objects.</p>

  alt="Example, Array."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Finally, the last type we're going to talk about is array, because in
some cases a function might want to return more than one value. We've
seen how the API can return something complex, like an object that could
be a paragraph, or a div, something along that line. What if it needs to
return multiple things?</p>

<p>Here I have var links = <strong>document.getElements</strong>. Not
element, but elements, <strong>ByTagName('a')</strong>. We're going to
go in, it's going to search the entire document, and find all the
hyperlinks in the page. Well, that's certainly not going to return just
a single number, or a bunch of strings, or even a single object.
Instead, it needs to return a whole collection.</p>

  alt="Example, Accessing Array Elements."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Arrays store these multiple values using a variable name, just like
the ones we've done, but it also includes what we call an index for each
element in the array.</p>

<p>This is the same example where I say hey, go out and grab all the
links. Now if I wanted to write some sort of element out, I could say
<strong>document.write(links[0])</strong>, and it would say return the
very first link I saw. If I had links three, it would actually return
the fourth one because computers love to talk starting from zero and up.
Now we're going to have an entire lecture or more on arrays later in
this course. But for now, I just want you to realize that it's one of
the data types that can be returned.</p>

Let's see what happens when I type in a string to this sample code. I'm
going to put in for what is your name, I'll put in Coleen.</p>

<p>If we look at the code, what I was doing here is I was just prompting
for the name and then I want to write out the name. Boom, there's
Colleen. And then I want to say, hey, what happens if I add H1 elements
on each side. You haven't seen this plus before, and we're going to be
talking about it soon, but what we're doing right now is we're doing
what's called concatenating. We're saying take the name and add H1 on
either side. So, boom, I get it bigger now. I also want to print out the
title. That's a string. I also want to print out right here
<strong>document.getElementsByTagName('p')</strong>. This is where we're
using an array, and I just want to show you this because there's a
really good chance this message might pop up for you and I don't want
you to get freaked out about it.</p>

add a few, they can even be empty. Gotta love when it keeps popping up

<p>Luckily in JavaScript, there's a ton of flexibility with the
different types of data you can use. In other programming languages
they're very strict, but here with JavaScript they want you to have the
power to try different things.</p>

<p>For now, I want you to focus on learning what types of data are
returned from those common APIs. If you do
<strong>getElementByID</strong>, does that return a number, a string, an
object, or an array? If you do something along the lines of
<strong>getTitle</strong> or <strong>getLinks</strong>, what types of
things are those returning? If you can play with that and start to feel
comfortable knowing what the types are, even if you don't know how they
work, you're really going to be on your way to doing some cool
programming. So good luck.</p>

<p>Today we're going to be talking about expressions and mainly operators, the different 
ways that you can manipulate your code. We've been using statements to execute our 
JavaScript code. Every time you saw a line that ended with a semicolon, we were writing 
a statement.</p>

<p>Statements often have what we call expressions, or things that can be evaluated. 
Expressions produce values. They might produce a number, or a string, but many times 
they produce what we call Boolean values. I want to show you all the different types 
of operators that we can use in JavaScript to produce these types of expression values.</p>

<p>If you think back, I tend to talked about that left hand side equals right hand side. 
With the left-hand side is a variable and the right-hand side is that new value we want 
to be stored.</p>

<p>What are our tools for generating different values on that right hand side? We've seen 
direct assignments or calls to different functions but there's more to it that we can do 
than just that.</p>

<p>Here's a very simple assignment expression. I just had x=5 or in another example I 
said y=12. What's going on here is not an equal or a thing if two things are the same. 
In this expression I'm saying, go find the value that is story in y. After I grab that, 
go and store it in x as well.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image093.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Arithmetic Operators"
  alt="Arithmetic Operators."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>We also have arithmetic operators. Most of these are very straight
forward. You've probably seen plus, minus, this is multiplied, and then
we also have divide. And these are the straightforward math that you
learned, hopefully in somewhere around third or fourth grade at the
latest. 2 + 5 is 7. 5- 2 is 3. 2 * 5 is 10. 5/2 is 2.5.</p>

<p>But this last one, the modulus operator is something you may not have
seen before. It goes back to the idea of old long division. If you do
5/2 and you're looking only at the whole numbers, you have 2. What's
that leftover number that's kind of left over at the end. 5%2 is 1. See
if I can do another one here.</p>

<p>What would happen if I did something along the lines of 13/5? Well,
13/5 would give us something along of 2.blah, blah, blah. If I do 13%5,
you figure out how many times does 5 go into 13? That's 2, and what's
left over? 13%5 is going to be 3. Go ahead and play with that if you'd
like, and type a few numbers in and see what kind of response you
get.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  title="More Operators"
  alt="More Operators."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Some additional operators we have are the plus plus and minus minus.
This is the increment and the decrement. It's the same thing as saying,
take whatever I had before and add 1 to it. Or take whatever I had
before and subtract 1 from it. A third operator that's very similar is
the plus equals. You can also have minus equals. It's the same thing as
writing out long something along the lines of x = x + 2. It's the same
thing as saying x + = 2. It's just short hand you don't need to use it.
But I wanted to show you just in case you see it in somebody else’s
code.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  title="String Operators"
  alt="String Operators."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>We talked about how plus will add two numbers together. That's only true if the 
operators on both sides are numbers. In some cases, we have the string operators, and 
in that case, the plus is actually a concatenation. It'll take the ‘Hi’ and the ‘There’ 
and put it together into one variable. If you want to put those spaces in, you have to
remember to actually add them.</p>

<p>In the same case, if I have a string and a number, and I use the plus, it's going to 
be concatenation. You want to be careful when you're playing with this, because anything 
that's read in from a prompt is a string. You're going to need to make sure that your 
output is what you're expecting. The plus equals has the same effect as the plus equals 
from before. It just means take whatever I used to have and concatenate this new part on 
to it.</p>

  alt="Boolean Operators, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Those first few operators, we use usually to assign values to a
variable. Sometimes we use what we call Boolean operators to compare
values instead. In this case, let's assume that I'm assigned x = 12.
Well, some of the different Boolean operators I can use are equal equal,
which means don't set x equal to 5, instead, I want you to check, is the
value stored in x equal to 5? This is kind of a test case. Well, in this
case, no, it doesn't, so it returns false. But if I have x==12, oh okay,
yep, those two things are equivalent, so I'm going to return true.
There's also another short hand, which is the exclamation point equals.
This is a negation or the opposite, it says, hey, make sure the value
stored in x doesn't equal 5.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>We also have more of the traditional greater than, greater than or
equal to, less than, or less than or equal to, where they just compare
the left-hand side and the right-hand side and they return true or
false.</p>

<p>With JavaScript we have a special case, though. And that's because in
JavaScript we don't really care about types too much. What happens if
you want to see if a number is equal to something else, but you don't
want it to say yes if it's a string?</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Here I've got the equality statement that we used before, which is
equal equal. If I were to say x == "12" the string, JavaScript would say
yep, yep they're the same. Even though to us it's probably not the case
that 12 the number and 12 the string are the same thing. If you're
looking for what we call equality with type you would use the equal
equal equal, the triple equal operator. And that checks and says, hey
are these two values the same? And are they the same type? This is just
one more thing to put in your arsenal as you start programming.</p>

<p>Now I'm putting in this little note here, because I need you to stop and think
about these operators and what we've been talking about. It is complete
human nature to read this and nod along. Got it? Yep. Got it, got it.
And just think you've really grasped everything I've been talking about.
It's really hard to understand how these things work unless you type in
some examples, play with the numbers, and try to fool yourself and give
yourself tricky situations. If you can do that, then you'll feel
comfortable moving on with these operators.</p>

<p>Let's do one last little group or two groups before we finish up. In
this case, I have what we call the and and (&amp;&amp;). This stands for
“and”. It means, hey are the things on the left-hand side, and the
right-hand side, are they both true? The pipes, the straight up and down
the lines, this is what we call “or”. In this case, you might want to
say at least one side must be true in order for me to say true.</p>

<p>And then we have the exclamation part “not”, just kind of like this
negation. If I had to come up with an example for using and and or, one
might be that in order to enroll in courses at University of Michigan
you have to be an enrolled student and your tuition has to be paid up.
It doesn't work if it's only one or the other. For the “or”, you might
use the example that in America, you can't get into certain movies
unless you're 18 or you're with your parents. So that would be a case
where you only need one thing to be true.</p>

these different things.</p>

<p>And before you start programming yourself, make sure you think about
the logic you want to go into your program. Do you want to use greater
than or greater than or equal? Do you want to use the and or do you want
to use the or? If you think about these things before you start, and
then you go in and test them a lot, your code is going to be a lot

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>The next module on functions is crucial to any type of programming
that you may do in the future. The reason that programming languages
work so well is that they allow people to reuse work that other people
have done. Someone else writes the complex code that can determine what
time it is in any given country? Excellent. If they put that code in a
function then you can use it without really knowing the details of how
it works. (And yes, there is a function for that.)</p>

<p>We have already used some built-in functions (also called methods) such as 
document.getElementById(), alert(), document.innerHTML(), prompt(), etc. But did you 
know that you can also write your own functions? Start off by reading the following 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

<p>One of the things I want you to watch for in this next module is the
distinction between <em><strong>defining</strong></em> a function
(writing the code) and <em><strong>calling</strong></em> a function
(running the code at the precise time you want it to happen).</p>

<p>Functions of course, like everything else in programming, have
special syntax that you need to follow. In order to declare a function
so that you can use it later, you need to use the special keyword,
function, f-u-n-c-t-i-o-n. It's not an abbreviated such as, var, so make
sure you write out the whole thing. Once you write out function you can
give it any name you want. Stick to the same rules as the variables,
only use letters, and digits, and underscores.<p>

<p>Next, this third thing I have inside here, inside the parenthesis, are what 
we call the parameters. Sometimes there'll be things in here, sometimes there 
won't. Once you have what we call the function header, where you have function,
the name, the parentheses and any type of information in here. We're going use 
curly brackets to begin and end our function.</p>

<p>It's really important right here that you realize that you do not put a semi-
colon right here at the end. In all of our other JavaScript expressions and 
statements, we ended them with a semicolon. If you do that here, you're going 
to mess up your code. All those statements go inside here. And how it works is 
that later, then when people run your function, it'll execute all the code that's 
in {code you want to run}. And this code is just general code you would always 
write with your semicolons, your expression, your statements. It's just a really 
nice way to save it. You don't have to keep typing it over and over again.</p>

<p>Let me show you an example. In this case, I declared a function called 
<strong>welcomeMsg</strong>. And I didn't put anything inside the parenthesis. 
Because I said, you know what it is doesn't matter. Every time I run this function, 
all I want to happen is to have an alert that says, Welcome to JavaScript. And 
this will work numerous times. I don't have to keep writing things over and over 
again. It's a small function, but it's something that will work.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Here's another very similar function. The only difference is that, this time, 
I went ahead and I included a parameter list, which says, hey, now instead of 
saying Welcome to JavaScript every time we run this function. It's going to give 
an alert of whatever message you tell it to do in what we call it real time.</p>

<p>The first step in using functions is to do this function declaration, where 
you use the keywords, the curly brackets, and the parenthesis. Declaring a 
function doesn't actually do anything for you though. You need to tell the 
computer when you want that function to run.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>We do this by saying or we call the function. Every time you write
the function name, you're telling the computer that you want to run that
code. Calling a function changes what we call the program flow. Before
our programs start at the top and just work their way down line by line
by line. Now with functions, the computer is actually jumping around in
memory and executing different parts of code, not necessarily in the
order that you write them.</p>

<p>Here's an example. I have my <strong>welcomeMsg</strong> function,
the one with the parameters. Over here, in my HTML file, or JavaScript
file, the file I'm running, is the computer gets down here, it says, oh,
I know how to do that, check. Then it gets to our function call, where
it says oh, I'm going to leave here and I'm going to go over and run
this code. As soon as it's done running this code, it comes back to the
next line of code. Well, we know how to say x = "Goodbye", the computer
knows how to assign that new value. When we go here, once again, we go
back up to this code and then back down here. The code looks quite
straightforward to you, and when it runs it should look straightforward
to you. But it's important to know that behind the scenes there's a lot
going on as the computer jumps from different bits of code back to other
bits of code. Hopefully if you type this in and run it, you should get a
hello and then a goodbye message. You could type putting in numbers or
anything you'd like instead if you prefer.</p>

<p>Let's talk a little bit more about those parameters that I talked
about. Because sometimes some functions need a little bit of extra
information in order to perform its task.</p>

<p>Let's think about <strong>getElementById</strong>. That's not really
going to work unless you tell it which ID you're looking for. That's an
extra piece of information or a parameter that you need to provide. The
important thing to know is the names of the parameters for your
functions, they're not important, they're like variable names. You can
call them anything you want, as long as you're consistent.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>The next thing to talk about, when we talk about functions, are
return values. Some functions return values, others don't. But these
values can be used later for assignment statements or conditional
expressions. Later when we talk about forms, we're going to want to put
in special functions that will say, hey, I need you to halt execution
right now, because I don't want you to hit submit. I don't want you to
be able to hit yes on that form.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let's look an example of a function that returns a value. In this
case, I've written a simple function that takes your message that you
want to say, hello or good afternoon, good morning, but we're going to
follow that up with a prompt. And that prompt's going to ask a person
for their name. We're combining a few different elements here. We start
off by saying, hey, I'm going to make a variable called firstName, and I
want to set it to whatever the person types into the prompt. If over
here, if I don't have the term var, firstName would be left as something
that's empty. Using return statements are just typically used in order
to assign values to valuables or to check conditional statements, and
we're going to be using these a lot. I just need you to be aware of the
term.</p>

  alt="2.01 Review: Functions."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let's review what we've talked about with functions so far. Whenever
possible, use built in functions. Sometimes when people are first
learning how to program, they feel this need to write everything from
scratch to show that they really understand. There's really no point in
doing that at the beginning. If someone else has written a really good
function use it. You can practice your own skills by augmenting it or
adding little things.</p>

<p>When you do write your own function, try not to be too specific. And
what I mean by that is, don't write a function that you're not going to
be able to reuse multiple times in a lot of different scenarios. Don't
hard-code too many values so that it's so specific that it only works
for one person.</p>

<p>Finally, I just want to remind you, that function parameters can have
any name you want them to have. A lot of times people get caught up in
my examples, and think that's the only way to go. It's not the case.
Don't do everything exactly the way you see it online, or in my
examples. It gives you a lot more power if you change those parameter
names, to see how the inner workings are going.</p>

<p>We're going to be using functions a lot in this class. You're going
to be writing your own functions in the homework, and I'm hoping that
you'll be able to do this and feel like you're really starting to
understand some of the power of JavaScript. Good luck.</p>

<p>Up to this point, we've been putting our JavaScript into the HTML
body tag. Now, it's fine to start off that way, but as we get more and
more complex, it's going to make your life easier if we separate our
content from our other style in JavaScript functions.</p>

<p>In order to do that, we need to think about where we can put our
JavaScript code. And where you can put it, is you can leave it in the
body, as we've been doing, you can put your functions into the head
section of your HTML code, or you can use an external file.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 113. in the head (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image113.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="In the head"
  alt="In the head."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If you decide to put your JavaScript functions in the head section,
that's a really great idea, because they're separated from the content
and it makes it a little bit easier for you to follow the code that
you're writing. It doesn't make any difference to the actual execution,
but it just might make the debugging easier.</p>

<p>If you're going to use this method, you need to remember that you
have to use a script tag. Just as a style tag, tells the browser that
your about to add some style to your page. The script tag says. Wait,
this isn't content, this is going to be some JavaScript code.</p>

<p>If you do this. If you put your code into the head section, don't
worry, all of your function will still have access to all the document
information, the ID's, the classes, etc.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Code can be placed in the head."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let's take a quick look at an example. As you can see, I have my head
section and inside there, I have this script ending, script in ending
head. You need to make sure that you have the proper tags, if you want
your code to validate. Inside this script, I put a very simple function
called message. Now, what you need to understand, is when I talk about
putting your JavaScript code into the head, I'm only talking about your
JavaScript functions. It's still necessary, down here in the body of
your code to call the functions. But still, it's a lot cleaner than
having the entire function written down here. Plus, for code reuse, you
can now call the function multiple times, but only write it once up
here.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 115. in an external file, #1 (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="In an External File, #1"
  alt="In an External File, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If instead, you decide to put your JavaScript functions in an external file, then you 
can use that code multiple times in multiple files. The one thing that's important to 
remember right from the start is again, when you're using external file, don't use the 
script tag. It's just the JavaScript, without any script tag.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Let's look at an example here. Here you can see, that inside the head section, I've 
gone in and I'm done with my script. But instead of writing the actual function, I've 
gone ahead and give it a source saying up, all my JavaScript is inside my JS folder, and 
here's the name of the file that I want to use.</p>

<p>If for some reason this doesn't work, you want to make sure that you're very careful 
about what you put right in here, you want to make sure that this is exactly correct, 
because if the browser can't find the file, then it's not going to be able to run your 
JavaScript. So, let's say, you do have a typo in your link to your external JavaScript 
file. Well, the problem with this, is that, it's actually harder to realize what's going 
on. If you mess up in your HTML code or your CSS code, it's usually pretty easy to figure 
out that you did something wrong, because the colors aren't the way you wanted or your 
text just isn't there. But with JavaScript, sometimes the changes you’re making are so 
slight, you don't even realize that you have a problem.</p>

<p>It's very important, as your code becomes more and more complex, that
you're using the console to debug your code. The console really is your
friend. I can't stress enough how much you always want to have it on
while you're coding. Myself, sometimes I forget to turn it on and I'm
annoyed later, when I could have found my errors so much more
easily.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Another way that we can talk about separating your code into this
external file from your HTML, is to use these different types of
software options, such as CodePen. When you use CodePen, you're able to
separate, have a separate window for your HTML, your CSS, and your
JavaScript. What's great about this is, it lets you see all of your code
at once and see in real time what's happening as you change that code.
The downfall of this, for when you're first getting started, is that, I
find that sometimes people don't realize that they don't understand how
to link their code, out there in the real world.</p>

<p>If you're going to use CodePen, I recommend that once you're
done, take that code and put it into three separate files, so that
you're sure you know how to link them together.</p>

<p>Let's take a look. As you can see here, I have one window for my HTML
code. One, for my CSS and one for my JavaScript. And code pen, takes
care of all the work of making sure that they're all together. If this
is your first time ever using CodePen, I did want to point out, that
there's this handy little function, that you can re-size the
windows.</p>

  alt="2.02 Review: Code Placement."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>All right, let's review what we talked about today. The first thing,
is that you need to feel comfortable with the idea that your JavaScript
code can appear in the head. Or the body of your code, or very often in
both. Code, can also be placed in an external JavaScript file. If you do
this, just make sure that you've linked the files correctly together,
otherwise you might have some issues trying to figure out why your code
isn't working. Luckily, the console can tell you, if it can't find that
file and it leads you down the right path to fixing your code.</p>

<p>Personally, I always develop in the same file. I tend to have my HTML
and my JS in the same file, while I'm doing my testing. Once I'm done, I
move it out into an external style sheet. It's really up to you to
determine which style you like best. Whether you like your JavaScript in
the same file or in a separate file. There are benefits to both. And the
most important thing for you right now, is to develop the confidence
that you can get your JavaScript working, in whatever way, it best suits
you. Good luck.</p>

<h3>Organizing Your Code</h3>

<h3>Code Placement</h3>

<p>When you write code, it is important to get into the good habits of
organizing your code. While there are no specific rules about how and
where to place your code, there are definitely conventions. (Conventions
are suggestions that most programmers follow. This way other programmers
can quickly and easily understand their code.)</p>

<p>The most common organization is to have one main folder with your
HTML files in it. There are also three subfolders (folders inside the
main folder) for your CSS, image, and JavaScript files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 122. codepen: separate code (74) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image122.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Folder with subfolders nested within"
  alt="Folder with subfolders nested within."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>When we use CodePen we use that idea of separating our code. However,
be aware that CodePen doesn't require many of the things you should have
in your code. For instance, in the HTML files it ignores all of the
information in the &lt;head&gt; section. So, if you develop in CodePen,
make sure to test your code later using the proper folder/file
structure. You will need to include links to the style sheets, images,
and any external JavaScript files.</p>

<p>I know that one of the most frustrating things that can happen when
you're designing and developing your webpage is when you just can't get
your code to talk to one another. If you've written some HTML, and
you're trying to link it to your style sheet, and they just don't seem
to recognize each other. Today, we're going to talk about how web
designers tend to organize and separate their code into different
parts.</p>

<p>First, we always start off with a main folder that's going to hold
your HTML code. In addition to your code, you're going to have a folder
for your CSS, your images, and if you're doing it yet, your JavaScript
code as well. Organizing your code into these separate folders, CSS,
JavaScript, images, it's not a rule. Your page will still work even if
you have everything inside one big folder. But as you go on in web
design, your fellow designers are going to expect that you have similar
conventions to their own. you want to get used to doing things the right
way, right from the beginning.</p>

<p>Here I've got a quick picture of how I could organize the code using these 
different folders. I have ProjectOne, ProjectTwo, and ProjectThree. Here in 
ProjectThree is where I really want to look at what we're doing. As you can 
see, I've got an html file, an html file, all four of my html files. In 
addition, though, I have my css, my images, and any JavaScript. We want to make 
sure that all these different files can talk to one another. And so, we're 
going to use the convention here, and I'm going to show you how to make sure 
they can link together in the right way.</p>

<p>2<sup>nd</sup> line should be: <strong>&lt;script

<p>Let's say that inside your HTML file, you want to link to your style sheet, 
your Java functions, and perhaps a picture. Well, this is the way you're going 
to do it. When you link to your style sheet, you want to make sure you include 
your CSS folder. You don't need any other folder, just that one. But be careful, 
if you called it css lower case, make sure your link says css lower case, not 
upper case. When it's time to link to your java files, you do the same thing. 
Make sure you start the link with that js. What this does is it tells the 
browser, hey, I need this file right here, but in order to find it, go into the 
JavaScript folder first, right?</p>

<p>Finally, the same thing, when it's time to link to an image, make sure you 
link to your image folder first. Now the images folder is the one that tends to 
have the most variance in the name. Some people call it image, some call it 
images. Another kind of common name is to call it img. When you're linking your 
code with other people's code, make sure you do a quick check. And make sure 
that your folder names CSS, JavaScript, and images match what other people are 
expecting.</p>

<p>When it comes to linking from your style sheet, it can be a little
bit trickier. In the example I have here, we want to link to this
holiday picture right here, all right? Now we know that the file isn't
in the CSS folder. It doesn't belong there. Pictures should be in the
images folder. But the problem is, how do you tell the browser that the
images folder is someplace different? In this example we go up 2
directories, find ‘images’ folder and pull from there. Done &amp;
done.</p>

<p>If things aren't working for you in your folder structure, here's a
few tips you can do just to see if we can find out where the issue is.
First, if the link isn't working for you, check to make sure that you
spelled the file name correctly. Case matters, upper case, lower case,
it can make a big difference. You also want to make sure that the files
are in those correct CSS, JS, or images (img) folders.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is a big one. As people tend to mess up on their
code, they open up new versions of the files. It never ever ceases to
amaze me how many times that I've done this myself, where I'm working on
a file, I'm making changes, and they're just not showing up in the
browser. Almost all the time it's because I'm working on a bad copy. I'm
hoping that this is going to help you understand a little bit more how
you can organize your code to make the best use of the different CSS,
JavaScript, and images functions out there. Thanks.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>First, let's talk about just some of the events that we normally
react to on a web page. The first one is <strong>onclick</strong>, it’s
very straightforward, if the user clicks on an HTML element, we want
something JavaScript function to execute. We can also have
<strong>onmouseover, onresize</strong>, and a very common one is
<strong>onload</strong>.</p>

<p>This last one says whenever the page is loaded, I want to call some
JavaScript functions or run some sort of JavaScript code, but please
don't do it until the page is completely done. The reason that this one
is a little bit more interesting to me, is that sometimes students have
problems in that they try to write JavaScript. But the page that they
are trying to apply the JavaScript to, is so complex and takes so long
to load that the JavaScript is done before the user can even see the
page. This last one onload we are going to use quite a bit to make sure
we are all seeing the exact same events.</p>

  src="./images/image132.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="How it works: Link events & tags together"
  alt="How it works: Link events & tags together."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>All right, so how does this work? We know that any element can react
to an event. Well, we need to add code to our HTML that links the events
and the tags together. Here's an example for you. Here, I have my tag
div, simple HTML five tag but I've added this event right here that says
on click.</p>

<p>Now the browser's changed, the browser is what I say listening. It's
listening, listening to this one div and saying okay, if anybody clicks
on this then I am going to call the JavaScript function message. All
right, this isn't going to happen just once, this is going to happen for
the duration that this site is loaded onto the browser.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 133. double quotes on outside, single on inside (80) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image133.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Use double quotes on outside function calls and single on inside"
  alt="Use double quotes on outside function calls and single on inside." 
  style="width:40%" >

<p>One of the things that we need to talk about is the use of quotes.
When we have our event such as <strong>onclick</strong> equals message
function or <strong>onclick</strong> equals add function, anything like
that we need to put the function inside quotes. And you can use single
quotes or double quotes in order to do this. However, I always use
double quotes because it makes it much easier if I want to pass string
arguments to the function. If you take a look down here, you can see I
want to call the function called message and I need to send it this Hi
message.</p>

<p>Well, if I'd done it this way <strong>(&lt;div onclick=’message(‘Hi’)’&gt;</strong>) 
equals message with a single quote. And then, what's going to happen when I try to 
send my screen? As soon as I add another single quote the browser goes, that's the 
end, it matches there's your whole string.</p>

<p>If you're going to be matching different strings together, put the
outer one in double quotes and he inner one in single quotes and it's
going to make it much easier for your browser to understand what's going
on.</p>

<p>Be careful copying and pasting quotes when you're coding. It's a very
common thing to do but it's important to remember that a lot of times
your editor gets mixed up. Because when you're coding, you don't have
that same kind of slant that Word, PowerPoint, and other programs put
into your quotes. Whenever you copy and paste, go back and make sure
that they're matching up correctly.</p>

  alt="Functions respond to events triggered by onload, onclick, & onresize."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's take a look at what I do with this code right here. I have my HTML on one 
side and my JavaScript function on the other. The JavaScript function's pretty simple, 
all is it going to do is take a string, and it's going to update the output element to 
show whatever that string is along with the word event.</p>

<p>Over here in the HTML is where it's going to get a little bit more interesting and 
it's going to be the first time we're using events, I have three. I have 
<strong>onload</strong>, which means hey whenever I load this page, I want you to call 
the message function and send it the message load. I have <strong>onresize</strong> 
which means if I change the size of the browser, I want to send a different message 
and then finally the last one is <strong>onclick</strong>. All three of these events, 
<strong>onload, onresize, onclick</strong>, they're all going to call the message 
function, but they're going to call it with three different frame runners.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what's going on. As you can see, when I loaded the page, it 
automatically had LOAD event show up.</p>

<p>What happens if I click on this paragraph right here? Oh, it changes
to click event. It's actually happening over and over again; you just
can't tell because it's so quick.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Call a function when you resize an event."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Now, the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to resize the page
and you can see, that it recognizes that there is a resize event. So,
it's pretty simple to go through, and I'll go back here, and had your
HTML actually change based on the different events.</p>

  alt="onclick call event to function display date."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The second example is, again, a very straightforward way of showing
you how the events can be linked to different element types. One HTML
element we haven't used a lot in my courses is <strong>button</strong>.
I avoid using it because I think that the semantics of a
<strong>button</strong> tag really conveys this idea of click me and I'm
going to do something, and since we didn't have the power to do that
yet, I really didn't want to use that element, but now we can.</p>

<p>What I have here is a simple JavaScript function that says, hey I
want you to call the JavaScript <strong>date</strong> function, this is
something that I didn't write. You know that it was written by
JavaScript partly because well, it's yellow.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>All right, so I'm going to use this function and connect it with the
<strong>button</strong>. So, I have <strong>button</strong> type equals
<strong>button</strong> and I have <strong>onclick</strong> equals
<strong>displayDate()</strong>.</p>

<p>As soon as I click on that, we want to keep our eye on where it says
this is a paragraph, because when I click on it that should be updated
to what the current date in time is for when I'm running this. All
right. Now, there's a good chance that this date doesn't look exactly
the way you expect it. Don't forget, computers are very specific, and
they're going to give much longer answers than we're usually used
to.</p>

<p>As we start adding JavaScript events and reacting to events to our
code, I just want you to be aware of something that's going on, that's
really quite complex.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 142. events change the program flow (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image142.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Events change the program flow"
  alt="Events change the program flow."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Before JavaScript, for the most part, our programs ran in a linear order, it would 
start at the top and execute each statement step by step, one by one and everything 
was really only executed once. But now that we have events, we're really causing the 
program to what I want to say, run continuously. Because as soon as I add that event, 
the DOM is now always going to be listening for those events. The API is saying, all
right I need to wait on click, onclick, onclick. If you add too many events to your 
page, you could conceivably slow down the execution of your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 143. mouse, keyboard, & frame event (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image143.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Events; Mouse, Keyboard and Frame"
  alt="Events; Mouse, Keyboard and Frame."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Clearly there are a lot more events than just the four I told you
about. We tend to categorize these events into groups. We have mouse
events where you can react to onclick, double click, mouse enter or
mouse leave, mouse move, you can react to keyboard events. You can
actually listen for certain keys to be pressed down or the least.
There's also what we call frame events, and we've looked at two of those
already. You can do onload, onresize, you can react to scrolling on your
page or even if there's an error.</p>

<p>If you want a more comprehensive list of events, you can really go
anywhere online, but I went ahead and I'll link one for you in the
course page, that goes directly through Mozilla. It is <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events" 
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mozilla Web Events</a>.</p>

<p>The important thing to know is that you're not expected to know all
of the events, it's something we're going to learn over time. Hopefully,
you've got this little idea of what events do and how you can start
using them to add a little bit of interaction with your page. Without
these events JavaScript can be limited in its ability to interact with
the DOM. We didn't have onclick, onload and be really hard to actually
work with our webpages.</p>

  title="Interact with the DOM using events"
  alt="Interact with the DOM using events."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Another thing I'd like you to take away from this is while events are
really cool, they are also very annoying. It's possible to put a
listener on every paragraph of your page or every dip and have cool
things happening all the time. But after a while, the usability of your
page is really going to take a hit.</p>

<p>I know I've said it before, but don't worry about memorizing all the
different events. As you code, certain needs will arise and you'll say,
I wonder if there's an event for that, I'm going to go look it up. What
I'm much more concerned about at this point and hopefully you are to is
gaining the basic idea of, I know how events work, I'm going to try to
implement one. And when a problem arises, as it probably will, I can
kind of fight my way through and make it work, just don't forget. We're
there on the message boards. We're happy to all work as a team to make
sure that your page is doing the types of cool things that you want it
to do. Good luck.</p>

<p>This is a great time for you to write some code!!! Open your editor (or CodePen) 
and write a small program that pops up an alert message when you load the page. Or 
better yet, change the content of your page to the current Date every time you open 
the page. Once you are done, compare your answer to an example I have here:

<p>The rest of the material is more and more examples of using Events and functions in 
JavaScript. If you are a little worried that you don't understand them after the first 
module, that is fine. Just read all the way through, try to play with some of the code, 
and then read them again. It isn't uncommon for it to take a few weeks to make sense. 
Since we only have four weeks in this course you may find that you are sometimes able 
to make the code work, without fully understanding the details. That happens a lot. 
Programming is something that comes with time and practice. And then suddenly the 
moments of "Hooray" start to outnumber the times that you are stuck.</p>

<p>Hi everybody, welcome back. It's time for us to take some of the
things we've been learning and put them into practice. One of the most
important things about learning a programming language is making sure
that you're getting your hands-on experience. Reading these modules just
isn't enough. It's great if you just want to learn about JavaScript or
learn about these different elements at a very high level. But if you
actually want to feel competent and confident in your coding, you need
to make sure that you're practicing. Let's dive into the code. I want
you to modify the code. And whenever possible, it's great if you can
break the code. Because it's always better to make your errors now. We
have the whole community around you. You can ask questions.</p>

change the style of the page that we're looking out right now. Let's get
started. In this example, I'm going to do something a little bit
different then we've done before. When I first introduced the idea of
events, I said that events are matched with functions. Well, you can
also match events just with JavaScript code, not a function itself.</p>

there's a lot going on in here, and a lot of places where people tend to
make mistakes. Let's just look at them quickly.</p>

<p>The first thing I want you to look at is this idea of using
document.getElementById. Whether or not you have these as upper- or
lower-case letters, makes a big difference. If you accidentally change
it from ById to ID as uppercase, this is going to cause problems in your
code.</p>

<p>The other thing I see a lot of people do, is they think that
innerHTML is a method, just like all the other ones are. It's not. When
you're using innerHTML, you need to make sure you use those equal, that
assignment statement, okay? The other thing that I feel sometimes people
really get kind of hung up on is the code that I give them. You can put
anything you want in here. Let's change some things. First thing I want
you to look at is this line right here. If I were to change this, I want
you to intuitively know before I do it what part of this page is going
to change. Is it the event that's going to change? Is it the button
that's going to change? Is it the whole page? So luckily, with CodePin
you'll be able to see it immediately. All right, wow, now I really.</p>

<p>Let's look at the next example. Okay, get ready. This example is
going to be a big one, because we do have a lot of things going on. We
have our HTML. We have our CSS. And we have our JavaScript.</p>

<p>Let's start with the CSS, because it's the simplest and it's not
going to change as this program runs.</p>

<p>I've declared two classes. One called <strong>.closed</strong>, and
one called <strong>.open</strong>, and what they do is, well, it's
pretty straightforward. The <strong>.closed</strong> one says, I want to
change the display to none. What's going to happen is, right down here,
this one right here, it's going to disappear. However, if I were to set
the class to <strong>.open</strong>, well, then now it's going to
reappear again. That's all we really need to realize, is that .closed
will make it go away, .open is going to make it come back.</p>

<p>And finally in the HTML, we have two events. We have <strong>onClick,

Let's see how we can write the JavaScript that will make that div appear
and disappear. Let's start with closeMe. I've actually put two different
options here. The code looks a little bit longer than you might expect.
What I need to do, is I simply need to grab the demo element by doing
document.getElementById. But now instead of trying to change the inner
HTML, I'm going to change the style.</p>

<p>And in open, similarly, it says, hey grab that element, and I want it
to go from whatever it used to be, and now it should be block.</p>

What if we also wanted to change the color, or the width, or many other
elements? This is where the idea of our classes can come in.</p>

<p>Let's change it over here really quickly. I'm going to comment out
this line of code. And same right here. All I've done here, is we're
going to have the same element, but the difference is now, we can
actually go in and we could say, you know what? For that element I want
you to change the class name. I don't know what it used to be, but now I
want it to be closed. And down here, I want it to be open.</p>

<p>Now I don't really have time to do this right now, but I think what
would be a great exercise for you, is to look at this code using
<strong>Inspect Element</strong>. When you do that, and you click on
those Open and Close buttons, you can really see that we're going in
there and we're changing the DOM. All those things, all those different
styles, you can see them in effect. Make sure you're playing with this
as you're coding along with me. I could review with you what we just
did, but I'm not going to.</p>

<p>The most important thing for you to do right now, is stop reading
this module and bring up some sort of editor code bin, and go in there
and start coding. If you don't do it now, you might start falling behind
as we get into these more complex ideas. So, good luck.</p>

<p>Hi everybody, welcome to my personal least favorite lecture of all
time. It's the lecture where I try to explain the word this, and how
it's used in programming languages. The only reason I don't enjoy this
lecture, is that I find it extremely difficult to talk about the word
this without using the word this. Try your best to follow along. And
I'll do my best to make sure I'm as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Why do we even need to use special key words? Well, because a key to
smart programming is using different functions. You don't want to write
your own code. You want to use somebody else's code. But a common road
block, especially for new programmers, is trying to figure out.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 169. referring to elements (99) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image169.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Referring to Elements; Setting up Functions for Reuse"
  alt="Referring to Elements; Setting up Functions for Reuse."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>How can I write a function so that I can reuse it over and over
again? How can I write this function so that different elements can use
it? But the function knows basically, how do I know what information to
use. That's where “this” keyword comes in.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 170. 'this' to reference itself (100) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image170.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="'this' to reference itself"
  alt="'this' to reference itself."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>This allows an element to refer to itself. Every object in the DOM,
has an automatically generated this. This “this” attribute allows you to
access an element's info. Without “this”, it would be very difficult for
functions to know what data to use. This is also used in outside
functions.</p>

<p>Let me draw up something really quickly, before we get to more
explicit examples. When you're writing code, if you were to say have an
A tag. And somewhere along the lines you say onclick. And you want to
write a function. How do you tell the function that you want to use this
particular a tag? As opposed to other a elements that might be in the
program? Well, you can go ahead, and you can somewhere put the word this
in here. Whenever the computer sees the word this, boom. What it's going
to do is it's just going to backtrack and go back, back, back, back,
back, back, back, back until it's, oops, here's an open tag. They must
be referring to this DOM element right here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 171. example, using 'this' (100) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image171.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, using 'this'"
  alt="Example, using 'this'."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's look at what I hope are a few simple examples of using the word
this. Right here I have four different elements on my page. I have two
awesome pictures from the 80s and the 70s. And then, I also have a few
divs with some text within it, right here.</p>

<p>Each one of these elements has been associated with an event. And I
want to show you how I can use the word 'this'. So that the events can be
very specific to the element I'm click on. Let's start by looking at
this picture right here. In the html code you can see that I have source
check. I have alt text check, and I also have an event that says on
click. I want you to log to the console the alt text of this particular
element. As soon as the computer sees the word 'this'. It's going to back
up, until it gets to the image. And then we'll say. They want the alt
text for this image. Let’s see what happens when I actually click on
this image.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 172. on click 'this' display alt (101) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image172.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="On-click, display 'this' alt message"
  alt="On-click, display 'this' alt message."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>As you can see, as soon as I clicked on it. The message Awesome 80's
haircut shows up, all right? If I were to click on this multiple times.
It doesn't actually show up in the console multiple times.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 173. on click 'this' counter (102) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image173.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="On-click, count of clicks"
  alt="On-click, count of clicks."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>You can see that there's a little number over here that says. Oh,
this has happened four times in a row. But the important thing is that,
I click on an image and the event knew that this was the image I was
clicking on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 174. on click 'this' log inner html (102) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image174.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="On-click, log innerHTML"
  alt="On-click, log innerHTML."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's look at the next example down here. I've got my div that just
says, hi there. Checking out a div. I'm looking at the second example
right here. On this one, I want I want to do something similar, but divs
don't have alt text. Instead, what I said to do is, log the inner html.
When I click on this div, I'm expecting to see, hi there, checking out
the div to show up in the console.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 175. function 'this' console log (103) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image175.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="On-click, log again"
  alt="On-click, log again."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>As you can see, it's working. These first two examples are very
similar. And that all I'm doing is basically kind of manipulating what's
going on in the console.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 176. function 'this' console log, #2 (103) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Function 'this' console log"
  alt="Function 'this' console log." 
  style="width:50%" >

<p>In these last two, I did something very similar. But instead of just
using on-click do something. I'm going to use this function on the
right. Here's a great example of code reuse. The first few examples,
concept only. This one I want to show you how I can use this same
function called <strong>displayID</strong> on different elements. On my
family Christmas photo down here, you can see that I have an id of ID-1.
On this picture over here, I have an id of ID-2. My hope is that they
can both use the same exact function called displayID. And even though
they're using the same function, it's actually going to show different
results.</p>

  alt="Example, on-click, function and 'this'."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's see what happens when I start to click. ID-1, ID-1, ID-2, ID-2.
Here's a simple example of us using onClick along with a function and
the keyword, this, to provide different data. I want to show you though,
a slightly more colorful example. That I think also makes this point
really well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 178. function showproperties() (104) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image178.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="function showProperties()"
  alt="function showProperties()."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>In this example let's start right off with the JavaScript. I have a
function called showProperties. And it is expecting to be sent some sort
of element. Remember, I can call this parameter anything I want. I can
call it element, I can call it e, I can call it elem. It doesn't matter
to the computer. As long as it makes sense to you, the general idea
that. Oh, I think I'm going to be passed a DOM element here.</p>

<p>Once you get inside the function you can do
<strong>document.getElementById</strong>. Basically, what it's doing is
it's grabbing this section of my html. Stating I want to change what's
showing up inside that little box. What do I want to change it to? I
want to change it to the alt text of whatever element is being sent to
me. I'm going to stop here and pause just for a second. Because this is
a great place for you to think. All right, she's talking about alt text.
So that probably means the element is going to be a picture. Because if
it ends up being a div or a paragraph, this won't break but nothing's
going to happen. Now, I'm going to show you the cool part of this. On
each one of these elements, I have shown property and the keyword this
which says send this image that I am hovering over with my mouse and
call that property.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 179. hover effect display alt text (105) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image179.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="On hover effect, display alt text for picture"
  alt="On hover effect, display alt text for picture."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's take a look and see how this works. I'm going to hover over the first 
picture of my dog. And I am really hoping that the alt text associated with this 
picture is going to show up in the preview, and it did. I hover over another 
picture, and I get with my boy. And then finally, in the last picture you can 
kind of see how once again the alt text is being displayed inside the preview. 
I've done something really simple here. And what you're going to do in one of 
the homework is expand on this idea and say. Not only do I want to change 
whatever text is showing up in here. I actually want to change this whole 
picture. So go back.</p>

<p>Follow this more complex example of using the keyword 'this' that you
can figure out how to change more than just one thing. How can we change
different things? How can we change the background color? Could you
change the border? Different things like this that are, you all know how
to do. But just because you know how to do it, doesn't mean you don't
have to stop and think and really process it in your mind first.</p>

  alt="2.06 Review 'this'."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>The key word 'this', the concept of the word 'this', can be really tricky
to grasp. It took me quite a while myself. And I don't think I really
understood it until I started teaching it. The important thing to note
is that repeated practice helps. You want to go in and you want to do as
much coding as you can. And then, if or when you get stuck, remember to
work backwards. Find that keyword and just start marching back until you
find a tag. As soon as you find that tag, think back. Think to the early
things you learned when you were first learning HTML5. Think about that
DOM and go. Oh, we're talking about this little part of the tree right
there. I hope this is something you're able to grasp much more quickly
than I did. And I'm going to do my best to give you the examples that
you can use to master this.</p>

<h3 id="ch2-06-homework">2.06 Homework Time!!</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>It is time to work on the Photo Gallery assignment. All of the components you need to 
complete this program are in the lessons, it is your job to put them together. Please note, 
the answer can be as little as 4 or 5 lines of code, or much more if that makes more sense 
to you. While you are welcome to seek out help on the forums, please remember that you are 
not allowed to post code. The code to get you started is here on CodePen: 
<a href="https://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/wKYxZa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
JS Gallery Homework (CodePen)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a keyboard user who does not have access to a mouse, I have not 
forgotten about you. Next week we will use JavaScript to add tabfocus to the 
images to make the site more accessible.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>In this assignment you will use the code that I provide in order to create an 
interactive photo gallery.  The goal is to gain practice with writing JavaScript 
code to update elements of the DOM. You will fill in the code for two functions 
– one to respond to when a mouse is over an image, and the other to respond to 
when the mouse leaves an image.</p>

<p>Your peer review is a learning experience as well since it will allow you to 
see how your peer's code may differ from yours, while still achieving the same 
objectives.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Start by getting your own version of the code.  You can either download the file and save it as a JavaScript file or use the CodePen example as a start for your own.</li>
  <li>Review the HTML and find the ids and classes of the elements you want to listen to and/or change.</li>
  <li>Begin by filling in the code for the function upDate.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>I highly recommend beginning with a <b>console.log()</b> to check that your event is triggering.</li>
      <li>I would then recommend that you use console.log to print out some information about the previewPic variable, specifically the alt and source.</li>
      <li>Use <b>document.querySelector</b> or <b>document.getElementById</b> to change the text of the 
        element with the id of image.</li>
      <li>Check your work.</li>
      <li>Use <b>document.querySelector</b> or <b>document.getElementById</b> to change the 
        background image of the element with the id of image.</li>
      <li>Check your work.  If it isn't working, use console.log to doublecheck the values you are using.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fill in the code for the undo function.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Update the url for the background image of the div with the id of image back to the 
        original value of <b>background-image: url('')</b>.</li>
      <li>Update the text of the div with the id of image back to the original text of "Hover 
        over an image below to display here."</li>
      <li>Host and share your site - using either CodePen or a hosting site of your choosing.</li>
      <li>Complete your peer reviews.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>What I really want people to focus on though is the Photo Gallery
assignment. All of the components you need to complete this program are
in these modules, it is your job to put them together. Please note, the
answer can be as little as 4 or 5 lines of code, or much more if that

<p>In this lesson (2.07), I want to walk you through how we're going to be 
putting some of the things we've learned into practice. And the main things I'm 
looking for, from you, are your abilities to do two things.</p>

<p>First is, if I give you some HTML code and some CSS code, can you
change the background image of an element? The second thing I want you
to try to do is can you change the content of an element? I have a very
specific planner to put into place.</p>

<p><a
href="https://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/wKYxZa" 
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2.07 Homework</a></p>

<p>Let's take a look at the gallery homework.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 183. example code giving this image (109) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image183.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example HTML/CSS code, giving this image"
  alt="Example HTML/CSS code, giving this image."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>In order to begin this assignment, I'm going to give you the HTML
code and the CSS code that will create this page here. I've got one div
and three images underneath it. Each one of those images has a link to
this source file and it has alt text.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 184. hover, styling with a bandana (110) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image184.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Hover, styling with a bandana"
  alt="Hover, styling with a bandana."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>So right here, its alt text is Styling with a Bandana. And did you notice that as soon 
as I put my mouse over this image, it changes the source image and the text for the main 
div. We're creating a photo gallery here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 185. hover off, back to original image (110) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image185.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Hover off, back to original image background"
  alt="Hover off, back to original image background."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>As I leave the picture and I go off to this side, we go back to the
original image in color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 186. 'with my boy' over image (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image186.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Display 'with my boy' over image"
  alt="Display 'with my boy' over image."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>When I go over the next picture, you can see boom it went in and
found out what the source file was for this image. It located the alt
text and use both of those things to update that upper dish. Again, I'm
going to leave.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 187. 'young puppy' over image (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image187.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="The words 'young puppy' over image"
  alt="The words 'young puppy' over image." 
  style="width:50%" >

<p>And I'm going to go over this last one. I've actually put in the
JavaScript function codes for you and the events. The one thing that I
need you to do is write those functions.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 188. function to update preview pic (112) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image188.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="New function to update and preview picture"
  alt="New function to update and preview picture."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's look at the functions I want you to write. The first one is called, 
<strong>upDate</strong>, and we're going to send it to <strong>previewPic</strong>. 
And I put in here, one of the things I want you to do is change the URL for the 
background image to be the source file of the image we were going over, that 
<strong>previewPic</strong>. The next thing I want you to do is I change the text 
of the div so that's going to show the alt text of the preview image. This is what 
we call <strong>upDate</strong>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 189. function undo/reset (112) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image189.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="New function to undo/reset changes"
  alt="New function to undo/reset changes."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>When we leave the picture, I want you to undo what we just did, I
want you to go in and I want you to change the text and the background
image again.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 190. example, background-image with example (113) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image190.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, background-image and background-color"
  alt="Example, background-image and background-color."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Just as a little refresher in case you haven't used background images
before, the background image is an option for including graphics without
using an image tag. It's really just another way to add a little bit of
style without affecting the content. When you set background images it's
always a good idea to also set a background color. Because sometimes,
the URL might not be valid or the browser might not be able to download
it.</p>

<p>Here's an example of me setting the background image and the
background color. In order to this we want to say the URL use this
keyword URL. And then inside the parentheses you need to put the name of
the file. Okay? Now in this case it just happens to be mypPic.jpg. What
you don't want to do in the homework is you don't want to hard code this
right here. Instead of giving a name, you are going to want to use some
sort of variable. Okay? After you do that, you're going to want to hard
code the background color because we're hoping it won't be there at
all.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 191. element text (113) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image191.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Element Text"
  alt="Element Text."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>For the element text, I'm going to leave that a little bit more for
you to figure out how you're going to do that. We've discussed two
different ways to change the content of the document. One is to use
<strong>document.write()</strong>. The other one we've used quite a bit
is innerHTML. You need to think about what's the best way to update the
content that's inside that div to have it display the message you
want.</p>

<p>Again, I really want you avoid doing anything where you are using the
actual alt tag. I don't want you saying, oh, look this picture happens
to say the alt text is happy. And you going in and hard coding something
and saying, oh well then this should equal happy. This isn't how
programmers work. The way that programmers try to do things is instead
you should have something is going to equal some sort of element, all
right? Avoid using quotes on the right-hand side for this assignment.
Really try to use something that can change as the document changes.</p>

<p>Okay, so a couple tips to get you started. The code you need to write
should actually be really short. If you are writing more than five or
six lines of code, you probably want to stop and rethink the logic
behind what you're working on. I wrote it in two lines of code and that
was each function in about two lines of code but I can see you putting
it more in to five or six to break it down in to small pieces. You will
need to think about how you're going to incorporate the quotes. Because
don't forget, when you mix double quotes with single quotes, things can
kind of get mixed up. You should also remember that if you want to put
two Strings together, you need to use that plus operator in order to
concatenate the Strings.</p>

<p>This homework assignment is meant to give you an opportunity to do
something that you're proud of. If you find yourself getting frustrated
or lost, you should stop and ask for some help on the discussion board
to make sure you're on the right track. But really, I'm hoping that this
something that you can do, that you can later use if you want to
incorporate it into your own portfolio. So good luck.</p>

<p>I thought about putting this next link in the optional resources

"Cheat Sheet" covers the major essentials of the JavaScript language.
Some of it we have covered, and some we will cover in the next two
weeks. And then there is a chunk we will never get to.</p>

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
JavaScript Cheat Sheet (display PDF)</a></p>

<p>So why do I want to share this with you? As you learn to program it
is important to step back every once and awhile and review what you have
learned AND what you still have left to learn. It helps a lot of people
to look ahead and start to see that they need to master the small stuff
before they can tackle the larger concepts.</p>

<h3>Tabindex and Accessibility</h3>

<p>Some elements on a page can take on the <strong>focus</strong> state
by default.  When you go to a page and use the tab key you can navigate
from link to link and through forms – all without having to touch your
mouse.</p>

<p>It is possible to add the focus state to other elements too by adding
the tabindex attribute to a tag. While (below)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>&lt;div&gt; My first div.&lt;/div&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong> is</strong> <strong>not</strong> accessible from the
keyboard, this (below)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>&lt;div tabindex="0"&gt;  My second div.&lt;/div&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>is</strong> accessible from the keyboard.</p>

<p>The number associated with the tabindex attribute is the tab order. 
By default, everything has an order of 0 which means that they will be
visited in the order of the HTML code. It is possible to give the
attribute a higher number, but this can be confusing if it forces the
site visitor to jump randomly around the page.</p>

<p>You can see an example of tabindex in use at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_tabindex.asp" 
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTML tabindex Attribute (shortcut URL)</a>.</p>

<p>To an eager coder this may sound great – "Let's add focus to everything!" 
But this would slow down a person's ability to navigate quickly through your 
page. Instead, use it only in places where keyboard access would be important.  
For instance, in last week's homework you created a photo gallery that used the 
mouse. By next week I will want you to update that code to also react to the 
keyboard.</p>

<h3>Using JavaScript with Attributes</h3>

<p>In the lessons ahead I will be showing you how to use JavaScript to
access and change some of the attributes on a webpage. But we all know
that watching someone do something and then doing it on your own can be
a bigger leap than you expected, so I want to give you a short reference
on two different methods I use.</p>

<h4>getAttribute</h4>

<p>If you want to access a part of the DOM you can often access it directly. 
For instance, if you used <strong>document.querySelector()</strong> to access 
an image element, you can then access its src, alt text, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>my_img = document.querySelector("img")</strong></p>
  <p><strong>console.log(my_img.src)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>console.log(my_img.alt)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes though you can't access the data directly and that is when you will 
want to use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_getattribute.asp" 
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTML DOM Element <strong>getAttribute()</strong></a> 
method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>my_img = document.querySelector("img")</strong></p>
  <p><strong>console.log(my_img.getAttribute("src"))</strong></p>
  <p><strong>console.log(my_img.getAttribute("alt"))</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="setattribute">setAttribute</h3>

<p>Similarly, you can often change the value of a DOM element by accessing the 
attribute directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>my_img = document.querySelector("img")</strong></p>
  <p><strong>my_img.src = "mydog.jpg"</strong></p>
  <p><strong>my_img.alt = "Brown labradoodle"</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes though you can't change the data directly and that is when you will 
want to use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_setattribute.asp" 
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTML DOM Element <strong>setAttribute()</strong></a> 
method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>my_img = document.querySelector("img")</strong></p>
  <p><strong>my_img.setAttribute("src","mydog.jpg")</strong></p>
  <p><strong>my_img.setAttribute("alt","Brown labradoodle")</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is nice to know how to change things with JavaScript because it
will allow you to leave the HTML alone, but still add attributes such as
my_img.setAttribute("tabindex","0")</p>

<p><b>This is a big hint for the future homework</b></p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Today we're going to be starting something that's quite different than what 
we've been doing in the past. In the first few weeks, I used variables that 
stored a single piece of information. We talked about numbers, strings, true or 
false booleans, or objects. And while objects can be quite complex where you can 
have entire DOM elements, the fact is they were just dealing with one element 
at a time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Storing Lots of Data at Once"
  alt="Storing Lots of Data at Once."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>But what do you do if you want to use multiple related pieces of
information? That's where the idea of arrays comes in. Arrays give us a
chance to declare multiple values that are all linked to a single
variable.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 195. declaring an array, #1 (120) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image195.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Declaring an Array, #1"
  alt="Declaring an Array, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>In this case I've declared an array called grades, but instead of
giving it one value, I've given it ten. In this next example, I said I
wanted an array called foods, and I gave it three values. In the first
one they were numbers, in the second one they're strings. My third
example, I'm finally going to get to where we can start using those APIs
<strong>getElementsByClassName</strong>. In this case, I have no idea
how many elements will be in this images array because I don't know how
many images were in the document.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 196. declaring an array, #2 (120) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image196.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Declaring an Array, #2"
  alt="Declaring an Array, #2."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>And in the same way, I could declare array by saying, you know what,
I want to make a variable, I'm going to call it listItems. And how I'm
going to assign it or declare and initialize it, is by doing
<strong>document.getElementsByTagName</strong> and giving it
<strong>['li']</strong>. Now it'll travel through the DOM and grab every
element that has that li tag.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 197. arrays (121) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image197.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Arrays"
  alt="Arrays"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Hopefully you've seen this idea that an array is not a single value,
but a collection of values. You start off by giving your array a name,
and then you can assign as many values as you'd like. Each one of these
values 80, 82, 81, etc., these are called elements. My array is called
grades and it has ten elements in it. Now if I want to actually use
these elements, I need to know that each element has a numeric index, or
a number that goes with it. And in arrays, with almost all computer
science ideas, we don't start at 1, we start at 0. If I have an array of
10 elements, The index goes from 0 to 9. If I have an array of 5
elements, I know that it'll go from 0 to 4.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 198. accessing an array, #1 (121) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image198.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Accessing An Array, #1"
  alt="Accessing An Array, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Okay, so we have our array, and we know, in this case, that we have
an array with 10 values in it. Each of those values is called an
element. In computer science, when you're talking to other people, this
is a term that you want to use, because then you'll really be conveying
that you're using an array. How do we get to those elements, though?
Well, each element is referenced by an index. If I were to say
<strong>grades[0],</strong> right here, well, the computer knows, oh, I
have this array up here. I need to go find the one that's in the 0
place, so <strong>grades[0]</strong> refers to 80.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 199. accessing an array, #2 (122) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image199.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Accessing An Array, #2"
  alt="Accessing An Array, #2."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>If I want to talk about <strong>grades[4],</strong> well this refers
to value 62. <strong>grades[0]</strong> is the first value,
<strong>grades[4]</strong> is actually the fifth value. If this is the
first time you've really experienced starting your counting at 0, it can
be a little bit confusing at first, but you'll get the hang of it in
really no time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 200. arrays with example (122) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image200.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Arrays with Example"
  alt="Arrays with Example."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>One thing I wanted to mention because it's different than in other
program and languages, is that elements in array don't have to be all
the same type. I could have an array, in this case called info, that has
a string and a number, and then a string and a number, and that works
just fine. However, it's very uncommon and I wouldn't necessarily
encourage you to do your arrays in this manner.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 201. javascript arrays are objects (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image201.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="JavaScript Arrays are Objects, #1"
  alt="JavaScript Arrays are Objects, #1."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Instead, we want to focus on this idea that arrays tend to have the
same values in them and that they have attributes and methods. Because
JavaScript arrays are objects and that gives them some special power.
For instance, we can refer to <strong>grades.length</strong>. We can
call the method <strong>grades.sort()</strong>, or we could even add
additional elements to our array using the method called
<strong>push,</strong> where we would add another element to it.</p>

<p>Now, if you start thinking about some of the different ways we can
use arrays, you can start to put things together. For instance, when I
talked earlier about <strong>grades[9]</strong> or
<strong>grades[8]</strong>, we knew exactly how big that array was
because we had initialized it. But sometimes you won't know how long the
array is, especially if you used <strong>getElementsByTagName</strong>
or something like that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 202. javascript arrays are objects (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image202.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="JavaScript Arrays are Objects, #2"
  alt="JavaScript Arrays are Objects, #2."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>It is possible to combine the idea of length and the idea of push to
come up with our own way of adding things to our array. Grades, here's
the element I need. I need <strong>[grades.length]</strong>, because I
know that's the last place where we don't have anything, and set it =
element here. These two things right here,
<strong>grades.push(element)</strong> and <strong>grades[grades.length]
= element</strong>, they're the same thing, it's just a different way to
program. This kind of flexibility can be really great once you get the
hang of JavaScript. But when you first get started, it can sometimes be
confusing when you see people doing the same thing in different ways.
It's a really great learning opportunity for you to try to figure out
which things match as you go out and see new code.</p>

<p>Let's review. As you learn to declare and manipulate arrays, your
code is going to become much more powerful. You just need to take the
time to switch your mindset from single values to collections of values.
And once you do that, we can start playing with these new API methods
that we haven't used before. The <strong>getElementsByTagName</strong>
and <strong>getElementsByClassName</strong>.</p>

<p>Quick note because I know this is a typo of a lot us make, is that
you're writing this the correct way. We've been using
<strong>getElementById</strong>, make sure you're typing this else you
might run into problems. Go ahead, start typing in some code, use the
console to make sure things are going the way you want them to, and keep
coming along with me as you learn new ways to use arrays to improve your
page, thanks.</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm wondering, can you declare an array? We've been talking about them, 
we've been using them, but I've been doing all the work. What if I asked you to declare 
array? Would you be stuck or can you jump right in?</p>

<p>After you declare an array, can you access the different elements of an Array? If you 
remember, each array is made up of as many different elements as you can think of. If you 
want to actually access this one right here, how do you do it? Next thing I want you to 
think about is can you add elements to array? If we want to add something after B, perhaps 
a C, do you know the proper JavaScript to use in order to make your code work? Let's jump 
right in. As I said, I have this code online for you. But I really encourage you to start 
from scratch and try coding on your own. And using my code as a reference just in case 
things go wrong.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at this code. I really want you to understand each

understand what's going on with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Let's start off with the fact that I declared an array with four
different elements in here. I have Banana, Orange, Apple and Mango, I'm
going to use those inside my HTML code. In fact, where I use them, is I
use it in the very first function called loadFruits.</p>

<p>When my page starts up, it's going to call that function and right
away it says, you know what? I want you to grab everything that's in
this array, all of it, and dump it right into this paragraph right here.
This is why, again, if you look carefully at the HTML file, there's no
fruits there. It's all being added by the JavaScript. Once you've got
that kind of initial setup for your page, this is where we want to add
elements to our array.</p>

<p>In order to add something, we basically don't want to add it here. We
want to add additional things to the end of our array. All right, let's
get started. In this function, it's going to ask us what our favorite
food is. Once they ask, we need to know where should we put it?</p>

<p>Right now, I'm going to draw up on the screen to get an idea of what
the index of each one of these elements is. It starts at 0, 1, 2 and 3.
So this means we want to put the next fruit in position 4.</p>

<p>Let's take a look. I click Add Your Favorite. I'll say Strawberry.
And when I hit OK, right away the JavaScript has gone in and said, oh, I
need to add this fruit to my whole array. The kind of cool thing is
that, it doesn't say 4 here. I didn't say, I want it to go in position
4, because then it wouldn't work if I wanted to add more and more fruit.
This is where these little elements are coming together. You know that
to add something to your array, you use the array name. We have fruits,
then you have to give it an index. And the easiest way to add something
to an array is to just use the length of itself. Originally, I had four
elements in my array. Perfect, I put it in position 4. Now the length of
my array is one, two, three, four, five. Because I'm using a variable
here, instead of hard coding a number. My program will work no matter
how many different elements I add. Length is the count of fruits in the
array.</p>

<p>Let's add two more. And I can add Peach. And I can add another one.
I'll just add Banana again because I have no imagination this morning.
There we go. This is a very simple example, but one that I want you to
master. I want you to go in there, I want you to make your own array.
Don't use fruit, use your favorite foods, use your favorite cars. Use
your friends and take them on and off. And see if you can do these
different things to manipulate an array. Once you feel comfortable doing
this, you should feel confident going on in this class reading
additional modules. And knowing that you do understand what's going on,
even if you make a mistake now and then. So good luck.</p>

different from the videos since I like to update the slides when things change.</p>

<h3>Writing loops in JavaScript</h3>

<p>Once again, the lectures ahead will contain content that is easy to read, but can be a 
little trickier to do on your own. So, let's talk about the relationship between 
<b>document.querySelectorAll()</b> and looping.</p>

<p>The beauty of document.querySelectorAll() is that it will return an array of elements. 
If you have twelve links on your page, it can get them all.  Same with fifty images, seven 
paragraphs, or the one figure. But when you have a lot of elements, you don't want to 
write a lot of code to update them and that is where looping (also called iteration) comes 
in. There are a number of ways to loop but the one I will use is a JavaScript for Loop.</p>

<p>In a ‘for loop’ you state what values you want to start with, under what condition you 
want to continue to loop, and how you want to update the value.  In the code below the 
numbers 0..4 would be displayed on the console.</p>

<pre><code>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  console.log(i) 
}</code></pre>

<p>This is a very basic loop and doesn't do anything that exciting.  But think about how 
we can combine it to use the knowledge we have learned about the DOM.  Suppose that 
someone on your team has styled a new class called thumbnail and you want to use it. 
In the code below you can see how quick and easy it would be to add this new class to 
every image.</p>

<pre><code>my_images = document.querySelectorAll("img")
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; my_images.length; i++) {
    my_images&lbrack;i&rbrack;.setAttribute("class","thumbnail")
}</code></pre>
  
<h3 id="ch4.00-add">Advanced Coding Techniques</h3>

<p>In the next few lectures, we will talk about more advanced coding techniques. Any 
programming language has the general ability to loop (run the same code multiple times) 
and to make decisions during "run time." The important thing to know is that while the 
concepts are the same among programming languages, they all do it a little differently.
Some use parentheses, some don't. Some rely on indentation, others don't.</p>

<p>The important thing is to understand the LOGIC. The examples we provide here aren't 
enough, you will want to change your code to come up with new decisions and different 
criteria to test different situations.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, let's do a couple Code With Me’s in a row just so you can start using 
your JavaScript to do things that are a little bit more practical. I know that earlier 
I did a demo with you where we used arrays and we kind of picked out one or two elements 
from the arrays, but it wasn't really anything that had to do with web design so much. 
So, in this example, what I'm going to show you how to do is how to randomize your 
pictures using JavaScript, so let's take a look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>I'm going to refresh the page here to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. 
And what I'd like you to do is keep an eye on this one image up here in the corner 
each time I load the page. This time I've got a picture with a tree, while before 
it was kind of that pink, beautiful picture. When I reload it again, up, I've got 
a picture of my dog Bacon hanging out near the woods and I'm going to do it one 
more time. And up, look at that, I didn't get any image at all. Do it one more 
time and I've got that kind of pink tree again. What I've done is I've written 
code in JavaScript that will pick an image randomly from an array of image names.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 217. html, add pickimage() (132) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="HTML, add pickImage() function."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's code this together. Let's start with the HTML code. Right here on line 11 I want 
you to notice that I've put in an event and a function. And I've said when the body of 
the page loads, I want you to run the function pickImage(), all right?</p>

  style="width:50%" >

<p>And just to double check, I'm going to scroll all the way to the bottom of 
the screen and you can see that I've remembered to include a link to my JavaScript 
file that has that function.</p>

  alt="Update source to a random image."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's pop back up to the top. What is pickImage going to do? Well, pickImage, 
I'm going to scroll just a little bit more here. PickImage is going to go to this 
image element right here, the one with the id of header_img and it is going to 
update the source to a somewhat random image.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 220. select image, set attribute and display to screen (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="Select image, set its attributes and display to screen"
  alt="Select image, set its attributes and display to screen."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's see how we do this in the JavaScript file. The function pickImage starts off 
with an array that I have called options. And what I did is I went through many of 
the images in my folder, but not all of them and just put them in as strings, so 
I have bacon_in_the_woods.webp, munising, bend_in_the_road.webp. I've got 
bend_in_the_road twice, think I actually in fact, we're going to get rid of a 
couple of these since I have extra, let's keep it nice and short and sweet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 221. select another random image from array of images (134) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image221.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Select another random image from array"
  alt="Select another random image from array."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>And I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 different images to choose from. Again, where did I get 
those images from?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 222. images in folder, select 5 (134) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  title="Images in Folder, select 5, then pick from randomly"
  alt="Images in Folder, select 5, then pick from randomly."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Well, I just peeked over here in my Images folder and I picked some randomly. All 
right, so again, all I have here is an array of strings, and each string is the name 
of one of my pictures. All right, well, we know that we have all the names, how can 
we grab just one of those names, all right? Hang with me here, we're going to be doing 
some math, we're going to be doing some funky JavaScript, but there's just one line 
of code you need to understand, and it's right here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 223. math.random (135) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image223.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Math.random"
  alt="Math.random."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>JavaScript has a random function right here called Math.random. And what it will 
do is it will return a number between 0 and 1, so 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, we want to take 
that number and we want to take the length of this array. If I have an array with 
five file names in it, I want to pick a number such as 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. I don't want 
to go beyond 4 because that's too big, all right? And I don't want to go less than 
0 because that's too small. So I find out how long the array is using options.length, 
then I multiply that by a number between 0 and 1. And then the last little thing it 
does right here, this Math.floor, that's going to change it into the integer, all 
right? It's kind of funky, there's some math going on, trust me on this, all right?</p>

<p>Now this part of the code picks either bacon_in_the_woods or bend_in_the_road or 
lake_view, perfect. But remember, in our code, in our HTML code, we need to have that 
folder name too, right? All of our images are in a folder called images, so we take 
images and we concatenate, that's the fancy word for squish together. We concatenate 
the word images/with one of these file names, now we're going to go in and I'm using 
document.querySelector and I'm using "header_image". Again, remember, if you use 
document.getElementById, you wouldn't need this hashtag, but I do. I've grabbed that 
one little element in the DOM and then I set its source attribute to whatever my random 
image is. And for now, I'm setting the alt attribute to blank. This isn't the best 
for accessibility wise, but it is really just a decorative image. And by including 
the alt attribute, I'm still saying, "hey, there's an image here, but it's not 
important, I'm letting you know that it's really something you can skip over."</p>

<p>Let's take a look now at this working in process again. This time when we look at the 
page, I want to have Inspect Element open, so I'm going to do my Inspect. I'm going to

it a little easier for you to read. </p>

<p>You can see, however, that currently the image is bend_in_the_road, let's refresh the page.</p>

<p>Did you notice something, did you notice that the image is missing? This happened earlier

<p>And in the console, you will see that I get the error that munising actually just 
isn't found. images/munising isn't found, it's a 404 error.</p>

<p>Okay, well, I must have had a typo somewhere, so let's go back into my code and we'll 
investigate the script, that JS file. Here we are in line 2, and we can see that I 
forgot to include the file extension, I don't remember what it is. It was .jpg, so 
I need to replace this with munising.jpg.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="images/munising.jpg found and displayed."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>All right, let's go back and try this one more time. All right, let's start refreshing 
again and see if we get that same error or if I'm able to get a picture of Munising to 
show up, there it is right there. So just to double check, I'm going to go in, and now 
I can see that the images/munising.jpg is correct, okay? Hopefully this demo shows you 
that there are some real-world applications to you applying JavaScript to your page. 
And it only takes few lines of code to do something that will make your page a little 
bit more unique. So have some fun with this and get your hands dirty, use that Inspect 
Element, and good luck.</p>

<p>Something I say often about my Web Design for Everybody classes is that it's unlikely 
that you're going to go off and become a professional web developer when you're done. 
Some of you may, that's great. But a lot of you are mostly just looking to become a little

<p>You can also put your images into a set like these four images here, where when 
I click on the first one, not only does it show the caption at the bottom and the 
X to leave the image, there's also a small chevron or arrow to go to the next image 
or to go back to a previous image. What's great about this code is that all of the 
JavaScript and all of the CSS for the lightbox is already created for you.</p>

<p>Let me show you how you can actually implement it in your code. I'm going to start 
by scrolling down here a little bit and they mentioned that there's a number of ways 
to get started.</p>

<p>For most of you, I think the most common approach is going to be to click on the 
link to GitHub to get their code. In order to get the code, you would go to Code, 
Download ZIP. While that's happening, I want to talk to you about some of these 
files and folders.</p>

<p>The most important one that you will need is called the "dist" folder. Dist is a 
really common naming convention, it stands for distribution.</p>

<p>If you're using other people's code and you're a little overwhelmed by all the 
folders and files, this is usually the one folder you really need. Although, the 
examples folder is usually a little bit handy as well.</p>

  style="width:50%" >

<p>I'm going to go back to the instructions, as we go through the rest of the steps, 
let me zoom in a little bit because the smallest typo can kind of throw you off. 
Once you've downloaded the code, and maybe you'd want to look at the examples, but 
we'll skip it right now you will notice that they mentioned that inside the distribution 
folder, you're going to want to link to their CSS and their JavaScript. This is the 
tricky part. In the example, it says path/to/lightbox.css. They don't actually mean 
path-to, they mean whatever the name of the folder is.</p>

<p>For us, it's going to be dist/css. Same here, when people talk about path/to, that's 
a shorthand, that's not actually the folder name, we're going to be using dist.javascript. 
The other thing that you might kind of read over quickly is we tend to be beginner coders 
here in our Web Development for Everybody. It's unlikely that you're already using jQuery, 
which means we need to make sure we use any of their code that says lightbox plus jQuery. 
Don't worry, I'm going to show you all this. But I just want to point it out when you're 
going through the documentation, okay?</p>

<p>Here is the format, what we are basically doing is turning every image on our 
page that we want to be part of the lightbox into a link, right? Instead of 
just being a regular old image, we want to be able to click on that image and 
then open up the image in a way bigger fashion, all right? Our new structure 
is going to be every place we used to have an image, we are going to put an 
&lt;a&gt; tag around it and that &lt;a&gt; tag should go to the image. Include 
this special attribute called data-lightbox and the special attribute called 
data-title. The data-lightbox lets the browser know whether you want all of the 
images to be linked together or whether they should be separate.</p>

<p>If you notice in the image sets (at the bottom), they gave everything the

  style="width:50%" >

<p>That's it, that's all the documentation we're going to go through. Let's 
go back to one of the pages we've been using in this class earlier so you can 
see how I implemented it. Let's start off by looking at my folder structure. 
I still have my css folder, my images folder, my js folder, but I've added a 
new file called lightbox.html. It's just a kind of shortened version of the 
neighborhood.html, so we won't worry about it too much.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 246. lightbox.html, again (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image246.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="lightbox,html, again"
  alt="lightbox,html, again."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>But now I also have the dist folder. I just copied and dragged to the whole 
thing. Inside the dist, they have their own css, their own images, because 
remember, for those little like chevron arrows, and their own js. Sometimes 
my students will ask me, they'll say, "well, why don't you just put other 
people's CSS in your CSS folder or other people's JavaScript in your JavaScript 
folder?" You can absolutely do that. But I like to keep it separate because I 
like to know if, when something's broken, if it was my code or their code. All 
I've really done is add this dist folder right here, let's close up the folder.</p> 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="lightbox.html, again." >
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Now, as we go through, you can see instead of path/to the lightbox.css, I've used 
dist/css/lightbox. I'm going to scroll all the way to the bottom, and instead of 
having path/to/js/lightbox, I've done the dist/js/lightbox-plus-query. I'm going 
to save this for just a second, and I'm going to open it up.</p>

  style="width:50%" >

<p>What we have here, as I mentioned, is just an abbreviated page where I only have 
four images. And right now, these images, I'm clicking on them, don't do anything, 
all right? I've connected to the CSS and I've connected to the JavaScript.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image250.webp"

  alt="lightbox.html"
  style="width:50%" >

<p>But now it's time for me to update my html. Let's take a look at that very first 
image. What I needed to do was I needed to add an 'a' tag around it. And if you remember, 
the href for that tag should be the exact same thing as the image itself. We want to 
click on the image and then open up that image in its own window. I have my data-lightbox, 
I've called it =images, and I've added my data-title="Caption 1", all right?</p>

<p>Just so I don't have to scroll back and forth for you, I'm going to hit option Z 
for a second, so it wraps all my text, all right? I've got my href, my data-lightbox 
images, and my data-title. Let's save it and let's take a look. All right, I've 
refreshed my page and I'm going to click on the first image. Notice, even if you 
can see it, it might be a little hard. When I put my mouse over the cursor changes 
to show that this isn't just an image. It's an image that's a link that doesn't happen 
to the other ones.</p>

<p>When I click on it, everything popped up and I got my Caption 1. Let's add this to 
the other images as well. It is super, super, super tempting when you're doing this to 
add this a link to all your images, right? Rather than just testing one at a time. But 
you always want to test at least one of them once just to be sure that you don't have 
a typo, right? So normally I add it to the first one and then kind of copy and paste 
it for the other ones. I'm going to save this and let's look at it again, all right?</p>

if I wanted to notice. If you're trying to do this along with me and the picture is 
popping up, if things don't look right, that probably means you didn't link to the 
CSS correctly. If things aren't functioning correctly, then that means you probably 
didn't link to the JavaScript in the right way. Use that Inspect Element so you can 
look in and make sure all your files are connected. But mostly realize how little 
code it took for me to take something that I've created and kind of bump it up a 
notch by using code that somebody else created. That's really what the web is about. 
All of us working together to create things that we can all enjoy.</p>

  style="width:40%" >

<p>Hi everyone. Earlier we did a Code With Me where we wanted to make one image, a random 
image. Now, let's talk about what we would do if we want to use JavaScript to update 
numerous images.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 254. example, michigan parks (150) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  title="Example, Michigan Parks"
  alt="Example, Michigan Parks."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>For instance, in this example, I have now changed the code so that I get three somewhat 
random images each time I load it. It's not super random because I didn't give it a lot 
of options, but you can see that it's three different pictures each time. Let's take a 
look at the code to see how we do this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 255. setimages() parks.html (150) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image255.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="setImages() in body tag"
  alt="setImages() in body tag."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's start off by looking at our body tag. Once again, I've used the onload event, 
but this time I've used a function called "setImages()".</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 256. see structure flex class (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="See structure, flex class"
  alt="See structure, flex class."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>If we scroll a little further, we can see from the structure of the page that 
the images I want to change are the images that are inside the flex class. Right 
now, I have 1, 2, 3 images in here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 257. at bottom, link to js folder (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  title="At Bottom, link to JS folder"
  alt="At Bottom, link to JS folder."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Then at the very bottom, I'm using my script tag to link to my JavaScript folder.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 258. javascript code; setimages() (152) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image258.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="JavaScript code; setImages()"
  alt="JavaScript code; setImages()."
  style="width:50%" >

<p>Let's check out the JavaScript code. Once again, I've created a variable called 
options, and in that array, I have listed a number of different images that are 
available to this file. Here's where things get a little bit different. On line 26, 
I've made another new variable called currentImages. Again, you want to use good 
mnemonic names, meaning when I look at the variable name, I should know what I'm 
trying to save here.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to save is all of the images that are currently in the flex 
class. I've used document.querySelectorAll(".flex img"). This is going to return 
an array of images. We can't just start using current images and trying to get 
the source attribute or the alt attribute. It doesn't know how to do that. We 
need to access each image individually, and this is where we will use looping. 
I start off with my ‘for loop’. You always want to use the keyword for. Then I'm 
going to create a variable called i. It's something we do a lot. I'm going to 
loop through each image in current images, and each time i is going to go up by 
one. Current images, if you remember on our page, there were three images. So 
that means I will go from 0, 1, and 2. If I had 10 images in that class, it 
would be 0, 1, 2, all the way up to nine.</p>

<p>I like to add console.log messages. They make me feel better. They help me 
figure out, is my code running? Is my, oops, that shouldn't say isSecure. I really 
just want to say i. I want to print out that 0, 1, 2, 3, etc, so I can make sure 
my loop is doing things as I expected. Now, the code should look pretty similar. 
I'm going to grab a random image and assign it to the variable random image. 
It's the same thing we did earlier. But now, instead of using something like 
currentImage, its currentImages[i], the first image, the second image, the 
third image.</p>

  title="Inspect Element, Michigan parks"
  alt="Inspect Element, Michigan parks."
  style="width:50%" />

<p>Let's take a look and I'm going to go back to the website one more time. Once again, 
let's turn on Inspect Element to see what's going on. I go into my Inspect and I want 
to pick the console tab. Do you notice over here? It says Image 0, Image 1, Image 2. 
That's from that console.log message I was using. I'm going to refresh again. And as 
we go through, uh oh, if you notice.</p>

<p>Oh, I thought I had mistaken there for a second. I thought it was saying it to the 
same image every time. So, I didn't write the greatest code, right? I could have gone 
in and written my random codes that it generates a random image each time but I keep 
track of the ones I've seen before. Or I could have made sure that there were like 
15 or 20 images, so the chance of having a duplicate was less likely. But when I'm 
writing code for all of you, I don't like it to be too big.</p>

<p>I want to show you one more thing. What I've done here is I've changed my style, 
so all my images have an opacity of 0.75 unless I hover over it.</p>

<p>Let's think about accessibility for a second, and think about what it means when 
we add hover to our style sheet. That means people who are using a mouse can get that 
functionality, but people are using the keyboard cannot. Let's use looping to also 
add a bit more accessibility to our page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 260. add tabindex to index.html (154) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image260.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Add tabindex to index.html"
  alt="Add tabindex to index.html."
  style="width:50%" />

<p>Back here in my HTML code, I can see that none of my images have an attribute called 
tab index. Tab index is what allows people to use the keyboard to access an element.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 261. tabindex='0' (154) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  style="width:50%" />

<p>I could go in here and I could start adding tabindex="0" to all of my images. In 
this case, I would only have to do it for three. But imagine instead that I had 
something like 20 images or 40 images, it would be a real pain to have to go in 
there and add that to each one. So, I'm going to go back to my JavaScript. Let's 
add two more lines of code here. What I can do is I can say, currentImages. Instead 
of the source, I'm going to use a new function called setAttribute(). I'm going to 
say, let's set the "tabindex" equal to 0. I'm going to save this.</p>

  style="width:50%" />

<p>Let's go back to the website. I'm going to refresh, and I'm going to go in 
and I'm going to check out these elements. Go right here, Inspect. We can now 
see that each one of these images has a tabindex="0" in there.</p>

  src="./images/image263.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  title="Update Style Sheet"
  alt="Update Style Sheet."
  style="width:50%" />
  
<p>My last step actually is to go back and update my style sheet as well. Here I am in 
my style sheet and I'm going to say, "anything I say people can do with hover let's also 
let them do it with focus." Back to our page. Now that I'm here, I'm going to begin to 
tab. It's going to go through my links.</p>

  alt="Inspect, Michigan parks."
  style="width:50%" />

<p>Now you can see it is also allowing me to tab to the images as well. Hopefully 
this is showing you that using looping is a faster way to update your code. Not just 
in this example where I had three pictures, but imagine if I'd had 15, 20, or in the 
case of your future homework, when you have six or more images.</p>

<p>Being able to loop and update the code allows you to do things more quickly and 
avoid a lot of those common typos that at least I happen to do all the time when 
I'm updating my code. You're going to be using this concept in the next couple of 
weeks, so make sure that you're going in and you're practicing, you're trying this 
code. And if need be, look things up on your own. There's always references out 
there. Good luck.</p>

<h3>4.03 "Cool Stuff" - Friend or Foe?</h3>

<p>As you are able to add additional capabilities to your pages, make sure that you 
aren't doing it at a cost to accessibility or usability. Reacting to mouse events is 
a great example. There are a number of great looking sites out there that are 
inaccessible because content is hidden until an event is triggered. If you are 
going to add Interactivity, make sure it is accessible to keyboard users as well.</p>

<p>If you plan on adding HTML forms to any future sites, I also highly suggest that 
you make sure that you are using labels and placeholders on your forms. The Web 
Accessibility Initiative has some great resources for learning about this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>4.03 Final Project Description</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The goal of the final project is to create your own accessible, interactive photo 
gallery. Building on concepts you have been learning in the course you will create 
your own HTML file with images and alternative text and then add the code to call 
functions to react to common events such page loads, mouse movement, and keyboard 
access.  In addition to reusing the functions from the earlier homework you will 
want to write code to automatically add the tabindex attribute to your figures.</p>

<p>Throughout the process make sure to validate your code on W3, Wave, and aXe.</p>

<p>Once you have completed your assignment you will complete peer reviews. Because there 
are two or three challenging components to this assignment, I hope you will learn from 
seeing the different approaches.</p>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Use the code from the Interactive Photo Gallery as your starting point,</li>
  <li>Update the code to use six images of your choice, making sure to include 
    alternative text for each,</li>
  <li>Validate your site on The W3C Markup Validation Service,</li>
  <li>Validate your site using the Wave validator site or browser extension,</li>
  <li>Validate your site using the aXe browser extension,</li>
  <li>Add the listeners for onfocus Event and onblur Event using the same pattern I gave 
    you for the onmouseover Event and onmouseleave Event (Don't delete those events though!),</li>
  <li>Test your site's functionality for mouse movement,</li>
  <li>Add the listener for onload – deciding what you want to call the new function,</li>
  <li>Add the new function for adding the tabfocus attribute,</li>
  <li>Add a console.log message to make sure that your event triggers,</li>
  <li>Write a for loop to loop through each image,</li>
  <li>Add the tabindex attributes,</li>
  <li>Test your site's functionality for keyboard access,</li>
  <li>Host and share your site,</li>
  <li>Complete your peer reviews.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Auditing</h4>

<p>Your project will be audited by the careful examination of your code by yourself as 
well as the "The W3C Markup Validation Service Tool" and the "WAVE Web Accessibility 
Evaluation Tool".</p>

<p>Your will look for the required functionality using both the mouse and a keyboard.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are at least six images,</li>
  <li>Each image has unique alternative text,</li>
  <li>When the mouse is over a smaller image the large image is updated with the alt text,</li>
  <li>When the smaller image is in focus the large image is updated with the alt text,</li>
  <li>When the mouse is over a smaller image the large image is updated with the 
    proper background image,</li>
  <li>When the smaller image is in focus the large image is updated with the proper 
    background image,</li>
  <li>When the mouse is removed from a smaller image the large image is updated with the 
    original text.  (Hardcoding is expected here.),</li>
  <li>When the focus is removed from the smaller image (when it is in the blur state) the 
    large image is updated with the original text.  (Hardcoding is expected here.),</li>
  <li>When the mouse is removed from a smaller image the background for the large image 
    is updated to an emptyURL.  (Hardcoding is expected here.),</li>
  <li>When the focus is removed from the smaller image (when it is in the blur state) the 
    background for the large image is updated to an empty URL.  (Hardcoding is expected here.),</li>
  <li>The tabindex property was added using JavaScript, not hardcoded into the HTML,</li>
  <li>The site returns no errors from the The W3C Markup Validation Service Tool,</li>
  <li>The site returns no errors from the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an earlier assignment, you added the ability to hover over images and display their 
source and alt texts in a different div. In this assignment, you're going to expand upon 
that same project. But now you are going to use at least six of your own images, and we're 
going to make it an accessible site by incorporating tabindex as well. I'm going to add 
some additional requirements that you cannot change the HTML to add tabindex, you must 
use JavaScript looping to add the attribute, and just as we wrote a ‘Undo’ for when we 
were on mouseout and we did like change when your mouseover.</p>

<p>Now, you are going to use the focus and blur events so that keyboard users have the 
same capabilities as any mouse users.</p>

<p>Let me show you an example. Again, in your earlier example, there were just three images, 
and I gave you those images.</p>

<p>When I would put my mouse over, we would get the updated image and the alt text. When 
I took my mouse off, we would get back to the original, over, out, over, out. In the new 
version, you will add at least three additional images of your own for total of six images, 
and we're going to use the Tab key to that people can use the same type of functionality 
as with the mouse.</p>

<p>Watch as I begin the tab, I'm going to tab again. I'm going to tab a third time, 
and now watch what happens when I tab this fourth time. It goes back to the original, 
a lot of students get into this trap where they only write an event for when it goes 
in focus. But the opposite of focus is something called blur, make sure that you code 
for both.</p>

<img class="border displayed"

  title="General Guidelines"
  alt="General Guidelines."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>As always, we're going to ask you to follow some general guidelines. One, make 
sure that you're using your own images, preferably something unique that your peers 
will enjoy grading. Validate everything, make sure you're using W3 to check your 
HTML syntax, make sure you're using Wave to make sure that you have alt text.</p>

<p>Make sure you are using aXe just to check for anything else. If there are any 
aXe errors that I left in there, I would encourage you to go in and fix them up 
so that your code validates. Do your peer grading with compassion too. You're 
going to want to make sure that you're giving really good feedback, if somebody 
does something incorrectly. You know what? Great feedback when people do things 
correctly, that's great as well. Leave those helpful comments so that other people 
can learn from you, and you might be surprised by how much you learn from thinking 
deeply about what you're seeing in other people's sites.</p>

<p>I hope you have some fun with this. I hope it's something that you are proud of 
and that you can share with others, and that you leave this feeling like you've 
really accomplished something and you learned enough about JavaScript that you can 
go on with some confidence.</p>

<h3>Optional ungraded submission</h3>

<p>Use this Gallery space to share your final project with others in this course. 
This is not required, but will help others that take the course and create a sense 
of community. Also, please take some time to review the work of your peers and 
offer thoughtful comments. This is not a graded submission.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The first time you launch the Gallery Tool, you will be asked to 
set up your Gallery profile by providing some basic information and selecting your 
sharing settings.</p>

<h3>Submitting your file to the Gallery</h3>

<p>On the left side of the screen, click “Upload Submission” and fill out the required information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title of your submission,</li>
  <li>A brief description of your submission,</li>
  <li>A link to your hosted project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch4-05b">4.05b Navigating the Gallery</h3>

<p>Scroll through the submissions to see the various examples that your peers have 
shared. You can also sort the examples by using the available filters near the top 
right-hand corner of the Gallery. As you explore the submissions, we encourage you 
to leave comments and feedback on the submissions you view.</p>

<p>This course uses a third-party app, Final Project: Submission Gallery, to enhance 
your learning experience. The app will reference basic information like your name, 
email, and Coursera ID.</p>

<p>Hey everybody, congratulations on finishing the Interactivity with JavaScript 
course by University of Michigan. I hope you're proud of what you've done so far, 
and excited to keep learning more.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 276. congratulations (163) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Congratulations, you are a noob."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>However, I do want to warn you right now that what we've covered in this class, 
you're still considered what we call a noob or newbie. So, in order to really 
advance your skills, you're going to need to keep working. But the good news is 
that learning the basics of any programming language, whether it's Python, JavaScript, 
some other type of scripting language. Is that it makes you feel like you've really 
done something that can last a long time. And it's true because these different 
concepts of variables, arrays, functions, and looping, these are concepts that 
repeat everywhere else. So now that you've just begun programming, you'll find 
that learning new languages is actually easier.</p>

  alt="Server-side Processing."
  style="width:40%" >

<p>Now, we've done a lot of client-side processing. So, I just want to talk to 
you one more time about the idea that what we've learned in this course is really 
only part of the picture. Learning about server-side code, or kind of hardcore 
programming, is something that you'll need to explore on your own in other 
courses if you decide that the coding part is what you really enjoy of web 
design. This full stack or back-end programming, they can help you with this, 
but it does require additional resources beyond what most people find on their 
laptop or phone.</p>

<img class="border displayed"

  title="What next?"
  alt="What next?"
  style="width:40%" >

<p>What should you do next then? Well, I hope you continue to practice your skills, 
because unlike HTML, and CSS, and some other components of web design, with JavaScript, 
if you don't use it, you're absolutely going to lose it. You lose these ideas. You forget 
about checking the console. You forget about the logical errors you made earlier. What 
you can do now, if you want to make sure you're still keeping your skills sharp, is think 
about joining a meet up, or offering your skills as a TA at different workshops.</p>

<p>You might also want to consider learning <jQuery. jQuery is an extremely powerful and 
popular programming language that's built up from the basics of JavaScript. However, I 
always encourage my students to understand just at least the nuances of JavaScript 
before you jump into jQuery because it can make your learning curve so much easier.</p>

<p>Of course, the other thing I must mention is that if you want to do more, I hope 
you'll join us in our Responsive Design course that we're doing in this Web Development 
for Everybody specialization. So, whether you're done and you hope to never code again, 
or you're really excited and you want to do more, I can't say anything else but thank 
you for joining me in this course. And thank you to everyone who was on the message 
boards mentoring each other and encouraging each other. Good luck.</p>
